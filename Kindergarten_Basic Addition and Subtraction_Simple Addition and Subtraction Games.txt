**1. Beach Ball Toss**

Materials: A beach ball with numbers 1-5 written on different segments.

**How to Play:**

1. Form a circle with the students.
2. Gently toss the beach ball to a student.
3. Whatever number their right thumb touches when they catch the ball is the first number.
4. Toss the ball again to another student, and the number their right thumb touches is the second number.
5. The student must add or subtract these two numbers and say the result out loud.

Example:
- First toss: Right thumb lands on the number 3.
- Second toss: Right thumb lands on the number 4.
- The student says: "3 + 4 equals 7" or "4 - 3 equals 1".

**2. Hopscotch Math**

Materials: Sidewalk chalk, an open space to draw a hopscotch grid.

**How to Play:**

1. Draw a traditional hopscotch grid and write different numbers in each box.
2. Throw a small stone onto a number to select the first number for addition or subtraction.
3. The student then hops to another number and adds or subtracts it from the first number.
4. When they reach the end, they announce the result before picking up the stone and hopping back.

Example:
- Stone lands on the number 2.
- The student hops to the number 5.
- The student says: "2 + 5 equals 7" or "5 - 2 equals 3".

**3. Number Line Race**

Materials: A large number line from 0 to 10 laid out on the floor or drawn on paper.

**How to Play:**

1. Have the student start at 0.
2. Roll a die to determine the number of spaces to move forward or backward on the number line.
3. Each time they land on a number, they must say the addition or subtraction equation they used to get there.

Example:
- Starting at 0, rolls a 3, moves to 3 on the number line.
- The student says: "0 + 3 equals 3".
- Rolls a 2, moves back to 1 on the number line (if subtracting).
- The student says: "3 - 2 equals 1".

**4. Puzzle Pieces**

Materials: Puzzles with addition or subtraction problems on one side and the answers on the matching piece.

**How to Play:**

1. Separate the puzzle pieces and spread them out on the floor.
2. The student should pick one problem piece and then search for the piece with the correct answer.
3. Once a match is made, they can attach the pieces together.

Example:
- Problem piece: "4 + 2".
- Answer piece the student finds: "6".
- The student connects the "4 + 2" piece with the "6" piece.

**5. Math Bingo**

Materials: Bingo cards with numbers 1-10, counters or markers, and problem cards with simple addition or subtraction problems.

**How to Play:**

1. Each student gets a Bingo card with numbers.
2. The teacher reads an addition or subtraction problem from the problem cards.
3. If the student has the answer on their Bingo card, they mark it with a counter or marker.
4. The first student to get five in a row shouts "Bingo!" and wins.

Example:
- Problem card reads: "5 + 2".
- The student with the number 7 on their Bingo card places a marker on it.
- Problem card: "8 - 3".
- The student with the number 5 marks it.

By incorporating these games into your lesson plans, you can help students practice their addition and subtraction skills while keeping the learning process dynamic and enjoyable. Remember to celebrate their successes and provide encouragement as they continue to improve their math abilities.
