## Chapter 4: Fun with Measurement

### Section 4.3: Light and Heavy

Hello little learners! Today we're going to play with some words that help us describe how much things weigh. Two of these words are "light" and "heavy". When something is easy to pick up and doesn't weigh much, we say it is light—like a feather! But when something isn't easy to pick up because it weighs a lot, we say it is heavy—like a big, round pumpkin!

#### What Does "Light" Mean?

Something is light when it doesn't press down hard on your hand when you try to lift it. A sheet of paper is light. A single crayon is light. Can you think of other things that are light?

#### What Does "Heavy" Mean?

Something is heavy when it presses down really hard on your hand when you try to lift it. A big book like a dictionary is heavy. A gallon of milk is heavy. Can you think of other things that are heavy?

#### Can You Tell Just By Looking?

Sometimes you can guess if something is light or heavy by the way it looks. A soccer ball looks like it could be heavy, but it is actually light! A small rock might not look like it will be heavy, but when you try to lift it, you might find it's heavy. It's fun to guess, but to really know, you have to try to lift it!

### Let's Do Some Light and Heavy Exercises!

#### Exercise 1: Sorting

Here is a list of things. Draw a line from each thing to the correct box (light or heavy).

- A pencil
- A couch
- A kitten
- A backpack full of books
- A sandwich
- A car
- A snowflake

| Light Things  | Heavy Things  |
|---------------|---------------|

**Answers:**

- A pencil -> Light Things
- A couch -> Heavy Things
- A kitten -> Light Things
- A backpack full of books -> Heavy Things
- A sandwich -> Light Things
- A car -> Heavy Things
- A snowflake -> Light Things

#### Exercise 2: True or False?

Circle "True" or "False" for each sentence.

1. A balloon is heavy. True / False
2. A bicycle is light. True / False
3. Stones are heavier than feathers. True / False
4. Pillows are heavy. True / False

**Answers:**

1. False (A balloon is not heavy; it's light.)
2. False (A bicycle is not light; it's heavy.)
3. True (Stones are indeed heavier than feathers.)
4. False (Pillows are not heavy; they're light.)

#### Exercise 3: Guessing Game

Draw a line to the best guess. Then, ask an adult to help you find out if you're right by picking up each object carefully.

1. Which is heavier? A watermelon 🍉 or a grape 🍇?

   Watermelon 🍉 / Grape 🍇

2. Which is lighter? A pair of shoes 👟 or a school bus 🚌?

   Pair of shoes 👟 / School bus 🚌

**Answers:**

1. Watermelon 🍉 (A watermelon is heavier than a grape.)
2. Pair of shoes 👟 (A pair of shoes is lighter than a school bus.)

### What We Have Learned

In this section, we have learned that "light" are things that are not very heavy, and "heavy" are things that weigh a lot. Remember to look, guess, and then try lifting (with an adult's help) to find out if something is light or heavy. And most importantly, have fun measuring and comparing the weights of different objects around you!

Now that you've practiced with light and heavy, what other light or heavy things can you find around your home or school? Keep exploring and measuring!
