# Counting 1 to 100

Welcome to the exciting world of numbers! In this section, we will learn how to count from 1 all the way up to 100. Counting is the foundation of math, and it helps us understand the concept of quantity. Let's get started with our counting adventure!

### Step 1: Understanding Number Groups

Before we start counting all the way to 100, let's break down the numbers into smaller groups. We'll start with the basics.

- **Ones**: These are the simplest numbers to count. From 1 to 9, we just say each number out loud: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine.

- **Tens**: After we pass nine, we get to ten. From there, we count ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, and ninety. These are our 'tens' numbers.

- **Mixed Numbers**: After every ten, we start adding the ones again. So, after ten comes eleven (10+1), then twelve (10+2), all the way up to nineteen (10+9). 

### Step 2: Practice Counting by Ones

Now, it's time to practice counting. Start with 1 and keep going. Don't worry if it takes a bit of time to remember what comes next â€“ that's what practice is for!

Here's the sequence: 

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 
31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 
41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 
51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 
61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 
71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 
81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 
91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.

### Step 3: Counting in Tens

Next, let's practice counting by tens. This will make counting to 100 faster and easier. Here's how you count by tens:

10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100.
