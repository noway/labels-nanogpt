# Basic Operations: Addition with Regrouping

Welcome to the world of addition with regrouping! Sometimes, when you add two numbers together, the digits in the sum can be more than nine in any place value position. When this happens, you need to regroup, or carry over, to the next place value. This section will explain how to do just that! Get ready for a fun journey into adding bigger numbers.

## What is Regrouping?

Regrouping in addition is a method used when the sum of two digits in the same place value is ten or more. If your sum reaches 10 or more, you only write down the number in the ones place and then regroup or carry the extra value to the next place value on the left.

Let's see how it works with a simple example!

### Example 1: Two-Digit Addition With Regrouping

Let's add 47 and 58.

Step 1: Write the numbers one on top of the other, aligning the place values.

```
  47
+ 58
____
```

Step 2: Start by adding the ones place. 7 (from 47) plus 8 (from 58) equals 15.

Since 15 is more than 9, we need to regroup. Write 5 in the ones place and carry the 1 over to the tens place.

```
   1  
  47
+ 58
____
  5
```

Step 3: Now, add the tens place. Remember to add the 1 you carried over from the ones place. So, 4 (from 47) plus 5 (from 58) plus 1 equals 10.

Since 10 fits neatly into the tens place and there is nothing to carry over, simply write down 10 in the tens place.

```
   1  
  47
+ 58
____
 105
```

The answer is 105!

### Example 2: Three-Digit Addition With Regrouping

Now, let's add 346 and 275.

Step 1: Write the numbers one on top of the other with each place value lined up.

```
 346
+275
_____
```

Step 2: Again, start with the ones place. 6 (from 346) plus 5 (from 275) equals 11.

Write 1 in the ones place and carry the 1 to the tens place.

```
   1
 346
+275
_____
  11
```

Step 3: Move to the tens place. 4 (tens from 346) plus 7 (tens from 275) plus 1 (carried over) equals 12.

Write 2 in the tens place and carry the 1 to the hundreds place.

```
  11
 346
+275
_____
 211
```

Step 4: Now, add the hundreds place. 3 (from 346) plus 2 (from 275) plus 1 (carried over) equals 6.

```
  11
 346
+275
_____
 621
```

The sum of 346 and 275 is 621!
