# Subtraction Stories: Subtracting with Pictures

Welcome to the "Subtracting with Pictures" section of your math practice book! In this part, we are going to use pictures to help us understand subtraction stories. Subtraction can be easy and fun when we use images to visualize taking something away.

**Remember:** When we subtract, we take a number of things away from a group, and then we see how many we have left.

Let's dive into some subtraction stories using pictures!

## Exercise 1: Teddy Bears' Picnic

üêª Once there were 5 teddy bears having a picnic. But then, 2 teddy bears had to go home. How many teddy bears were left at the picnic?

Draw a picture:
- Start with 5 teddy bears.
- Cross out 2 teddy bears to show they went home.

Answer:
- You should have crossed out 2 teddy bears.
- There are 3 teddy bears left at the picnic.
- So, 5 - 2 = 3

## Exercise 2: Balloon Party

üéà 7 balloons were floating in the air, but 3 balloons popped. How many balloons are still floating?

Draw a picture:
- Draw 7 balloons in the air.
- Cross out 3 balloons to show they popped.

Answer:
- After crossing out 3 balloons, you should see 4 balloons that are not crossed out.
- That means there are 4 balloons still floating.
- So, 7 - 3 = 4

## Exercise 3: Charlie's Apples

üçé Charlie had 6 apples in a basket. He gave a friend 2 apples. How many apples does Charlie have now?

Draw a picture:
- Draw a basket with 6 apples.
- Cross out 2 apples to show Charlie gave them away.

Answer:
- With 2 apples crossed out, there are 4 apples left in the basket.
- Charlie now has 4 apples.
- Therefore, 6 - 2 = 4

## Exercise 4: Playtime Blocks

üöß At playtime, there were 8 blocks on the floor. After cleaning up, we put away 5 blocks. How many blocks are still on the floor?

Draw a picture:
- Draw 8 blocks on the floor.
- Cross out 5 blocks to show we put them away.

Answer:
- There should be 3 blocks left uncrossed.
- So, 3 blocks are still on the floor.
- Thus, 8 - 5 = 3

## Exercise 5: Lily's Candy Jar

üç¨ Lily had 10 candies in her jar. She ate 4 candies. How many candies are left in the jar?

Draw a picture:
- Draw a jar with 10 candies.
- Cross out 4 candies to show Lily ate them.

Answer:
- 6 candies should remain uncrossed in the jar.
- Therefore, Lily has 6 candies left.
- So, 10 - 4 = 6

Congratulations on completing the "Subtracting with Pictures" exercises! Each picture you drew helped you tell the subtraction story. Remember, subtraction is simply finding out how many are left after some are taken away. Keep practicing, and you'll become a subtraction star in no time!
