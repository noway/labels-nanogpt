**Activity 2: Shape Sorting Practice**

Now, let's sort objects by their shape. Look at the following shapes: circles, squares, triangles, and rectangles. Sort the objects by matching them to their corresponding shapes.

*Example of objects:*
- Circle clock
- Square window
- Triangle sign
- Rectangle door

*Sorted groups:*

**Circle Group:**
- Circle clock

**Square Group:**
- Square window

**Triangle Group:**
- Triangle sign

**Rectangle Group:**
- Rectangle door

Well done on sorting the shapes!

**Activity 3: Mixed Sorting Challenge**

In this activity, you will see objects with different colors and shapes. Your challenge is to first sort the objects by color, and then within each color group, sort them again by shape.

*Example of objects:*
- Red circle
- Blue square
- Yellow triangle
- Green rectangle
- Purple circle
- Red square
- Blue triangle

*Sorted groups:*

**Red Group:**

*Circle:*
- Red circle

*Square:*
- Red square

**Blue Group:**

*Square:*
- Blue square

*Triangle:*
- Blue triangle

**Yellow Group:**

*Triangle:*
- Yellow triangle

**Green Group:**

*Rectangle:*
- Green rectangle

**Purple Group:**

*Circle:*
- Purple circle

Fantastic sorting! You've mastered sorting by color and by shape.
