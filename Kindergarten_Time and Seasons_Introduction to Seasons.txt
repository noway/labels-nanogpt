**Introduction to Seasons**

Welcome, little learners! Today, we’re going to enter the wonderful world of seasons. Have you noticed how sometimes it's very hot and sometimes quite cold outside? Or how the leaves on trees change colors and fall down to the ground? All these changes happen because of the seasons. There are four seasons in a year: Spring, Summer, Autumn (also called Fall), and Winter.

**Spring** is when everything starts to wake up after the cold winter. Flowers bloom, baby animals are born, and the weather gets a little warmer. It's like nature's way of saying "Good morning!"

**Summer** is when it’s often the warmest. This is when you can play in the water, eat ice cream, and you don’t need a jacket to go outside.

**Autumn (Fall)** is a bit cooler, and this is when the leaves change to beautiful colors like red, orange, and yellow before they fall from the trees. It's a time for cozy sweaters and watching the leaves drift to the ground.

**Winter** is the coldest season when sometimes it snows, and everything is quiet and still. We wear hats, scarves, and gloves to keep warm, and sometimes we can make snowmen or go sledding.

Why do we have seasons? It’s because our Earth takes a big trip around the sun every year. As it travels, the part of the Earth where we live tilts closer or farther from the sun at different times, and this tilting causes the seasons.

**Exercises on Seasons**

1. **Matching Seasons to Activities**: Match the activity to the correct season:

    a. Building a snowman

    b. Planting flowers

    c. Jumping in fallen leaves

    d. Going swimming

2. **Coloring the Seasons**: Here’s a tree! It looks different in each season. Color the trees to show the right season:

    a. Spring Tree: Use green for new leaves, pink and white for blossoms.

    b. Summer Tree: Color it with a deep green for the full, rich leaves.

    c. Autumn Tree: Use red, orange, yellow, and brown for the fall leaves.

    d. Winter Tree: Leave the branches bare, and you can add some white if there’s snow.

3. **Seasons in Order**: Help me put the seasons in the right order. Can you draw a line from the first season to the last? Remember, after winter, the cycle starts again!

Answers to Exercises:

1. **Matching Seasons to Activities**:
   
   a. Building a snowman - Winter

   b. Planting flowers - Spring

   c. Jumping in fallen leaves - Autumn (Fall)

   d. Going swimming - Summer

2. **Coloring the Seasons**: <|unsolvedproblem|>

3. **Seasons in Order**: Spring → Summer → Autumn (Fall) → Winter

Now that we've learned about the seasons, watch the world outside. Can you tell which season it is now? What do you see that gives you a clue? Remember that no matter the season, each one has its own kind of fun and beauty!
