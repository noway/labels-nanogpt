# Basic Operations

## Basic Division Concepts

Division is one of the four fundamental operations in mathematics, the other three being addition, subtraction, and multiplication. When we divide, we split a number into equal parts. Think of it as sharing something fairly among friends.

For example, if you have 12 chocolates and you want to share them equally with 3 friends, you would divide the 12 chocolates by the number of friends, which is 3.

The number you want to divide is called the **dividend**, the number you divide by is the **divisor**, and the answer you get is the **quotient**.

### Division Terms
- **Dividend**: The number that is being divided.
- **Divisor**: The number that the dividend is divided by.
- **Quotient**: The result of the division.

In a division equation, it looks like this:
\[ \text{Dividend} \div \text{Divisor} = \text{Quotient} \]

Or, written another way:

\[
\begin{array}{r}
\text{Dividend} \\
\underline{\div \text{Divisor}\phantom{nd}} \\
\text{Quotient}
\end{array}
\]

### Division Symbol
The symbol used for division can vary. Sometimes it is a slash ( / ), sometimes it is a horizontal line with dots above and below ( ÷ ), or it can be a line in a fraction (like in a/b).

### Let's Practice!
Now, let's practice some division problems. Remember, if you can't divide the numbers evenly, the part that you can't divide is called the **remainder**. But for now, we'll focus on examples that divide evenly.

1. **12 ÷ 3 = ?**
2. **15 ÷ 5 = ?**
3. **20 ÷ 4 = ?**
4. **18 ÷ 6 = ?**
5. **8 ÷ 2 = ?**

**Answers:**

1. When you divide 12 by 3, you split the number 12 into 3 equal parts. \( 12 \div 3 = 4 \). So, 4 is the quotient.

2. If you have 15 apples and want to put them in 5 baskets evenly, each basket gets \( 15 \div 5 = 3 \) apples. 3 is the quotient.

3. Dividing 20 by 4 is the same as asking what number multiplied by 4 gives you 20. \( 20 \div 4 = 5 \). The quotient is 5.

4. If you have 18 stickers and 6 friends, you can give each friend \( 18 \div 6 = 3 \) stickers. 3 is the quotient.

5. We know that 2 times 4 is 8, so if we reverse it, \( 8 \div 2 = 4 \). So, the quotient is 4.

Great job practicing! Remember, division is sharing evenly, and the remainder is what is left over if things don't divide evenly. We will learn about remainders in a later section.

### Check Your Understanding

Let's do some division word problems. Remember to look for the dividend (what you are dividing) and the divisor (what you are dividing by), then find the quotient. Good luck!

1. Tommy has 16 toy cars. He wants to arrange them into 4 even rows. How many toy cars will be in each row?
2. There are 21 students in a class, and the teacher has 7 awards to give out, one to each student in a group. How many students will be in each group?
3. A gardener has 24 flowers and wants to plant them in 8 equal sections. How many flowers will go in each section?

**Answers:**

1. Tommy needs to make 4 equal rows with his 16 cars. When you divide 16 by 4, you get \( 16 \div 4 = 4 \). So each row will have 4 toy cars.

2. The teacher needs to divide the 21 students into groups of 7. When we divide 21 by 7, we get \( 21 \div 7 = 3 \). Each group will have 3 students.

3. The gardener needs 8 equal sections to plant his 24 flowers. Dividing 24 by 8 gives us \( 24 \div 8 = 3 \). Each section will have 3 flowers.

You did it! You're understanding the basics of division. Keep practicing, and soon you'll be ready to tackle more complex division problems, including those with remainders.

Remember to practice division with objects like counters or draw pictures to help you understand the concept of sharing equally!
