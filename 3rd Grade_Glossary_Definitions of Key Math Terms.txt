# Definitions of Key Math Terms

1. **Addition** - The process of finding the total or sum by combining two or more numbers. Example: 3 + 2 = 5.

   *Exercise*: What is 4 + 7?
   *Answer*: 11.

2. **Subtraction** - The process of taking one number away from another to find the difference. Example: 8 - 3 = 5.

   *Exercise*: What is 9 - 6?
   *Answer*: 3.

3. **Multiplication** - The process of combining equal groups to find out how many in all. It is repeated addition. Example: 4 x 2 means 4 groups of 2, which equals 8.

   *Exercise*: What is 3 x 5?
   *Answer*: 15.

4. **Division** - The process of splitting a number into equal parts. Example: 12 ÷ 3 means splitting 12 into 3 equal groups, which equals 4.

   *Exercise*: What is 10 ÷ 2?
   *Answer*: 5.

5. **Number** - A mathematical object used to count, measure, and label. Example: 0, 1, 2, etc.

6. **Digit** - A single symbol used to make numerals. Example: 0, 1, 2,..., 9 are all digits.

7. **Even Number** - A whole number that can be divided by 2 without a remainder. Example: 2, 4, 6, etc.

   *Exercise*: Is 8 an even number?
   *Answer*: Yes.

8. **Odd Number** - A whole number that cannot be evenly divided by 2. Example: 1, 3, 5, etc.

   *Exercise*: Is 7 an odd number?
   *Answer*: Yes.

9. **Place Value** - The numerical value that a digit has by virtue of its position in a number. Example: In 245, the place value of 4 is 40.

   *Exercise*: What is the place value of 6 in the number 356?
   *Answer*: 50.

10. **Fraction** - A way to describe a part of a whole or a part of a group by using two numbers, the numerator (top number) and the denominator (bottom number). Example: ½ means 1 part out of 2 equal parts.

    *Exercise*: What fraction represents half of a cake?
    *Answer*: 1/2.

11. **Decimal** - A number that includes a decimal point to represent a whole number plus a fraction of a whole number. Example: 2.5 represents 2 whole and ½.

    *Exercise*: Write 3/4 as a decimal.
    *Answer*: 0.75.

12. **Geometry** - The branch of mathematics that deals with the properties and relationships of points, lines, angles, and shapes.

13. **Point** - A precise location in space with no actual length, width, or depth. Example: A dot on a piece of paper represents a point.

14. **Line** - A straight set of points that extends infinitely in both directions with no endpoints.

15. **Angle** - The space between two intersecting lines or surfaces at or close to the point where they meet. Example: A right angle.

    *Exercise*: Is a right angle smaller or larger than a straight angle?
    *Answer*: Smaller.

16. **Perimeter** - The distance around a two-dimensional shape. Example: To find the perimeter of a rectangle, add up the lengths of all four sides.

    *Exercise*: What is the perimeter of a square with sides 3 cm each?
    *Answer*: 12 cm.

17. **Area** - The size of a surface. It is measured in square units for two-dimensional shapes. Example: The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length by the width.

    *Exercise*: What is the area of a rectangle with length 5 cm and width 3 cm?
    *Answer*: 15 cm².

18. **Volume** - The amount of space a three-dimensional object occupies. It is measured in cubic units. Example: The volume of a cube is found by multiplying the length of a side by itself three times.

    *Exercise*: What is the volume of a cube with sides 4 cm each?
    *Answer*: 64 cm³.

19. **Data** - Information, often numerical, collected for analysis. For example, how many books students read in a month can be data used for creating a graph.

20. **Graph** - A visual representation of data. Bar graphs and line graphs are common in the 3rd grade.

    *Exercise*: Draw a bar graph to show the number of apples (4), oranges (6), and bananas (2) in the fruit basket.
    *Answer*: A bar graph with three bars, each bar representing a type of fruit and its corresponding number.

By understanding these key math terms, third-grade students will have a solid foundation for exploring a wide array of mathematical concepts and developing strong problem-solving skills.
