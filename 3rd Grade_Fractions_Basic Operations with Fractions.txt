# Basic Operations with Fractions

## Introduction to Fractions

Before we dive into the operations with fractions, let's recall what a fraction is. A fraction represents a part of a whole or a division of any quantity into equal parts. It consists of a numerator (top number) and a denominator (bottom number). The numerator tells us how many parts we have, and the denominator tells us how many of those parts make up a whole.

For instance, 1/2 means we have one part out of two equal parts of a whole. If we cut a pizza into two equal slices, taking one slice means we have 1/2 of the pizza.

## Addition and Subtraction of Fractions

### With the Same Denominator:

Adding or subtracting fractions with the same denominator is quite straightforward. This is because the denominators already match.

**Example 1:** Add 1/4 + 2/4

To add these, keep the same denominator and add the numerators:

1/4 + 2/4 = (1+2)/4 = 3/4

**Example 2:** Subtract 3/5 - 1/5

For subtraction, keep the denominator and subtract the numerators:

3/5 - 1/5 = (3-1)/5 = 2/5

### With Different Denominators:

To add or subtract fractions with different denominators, we have to make the denominators the same. We can do this by finding the Least Common Denominator (LCD), which is the smallest number that both denominators can divide into.

**Example 3:** Add 1/3 + 1/4

First, find the LCD for 3 and 4 which is 12.

Then, convert both fractions to have the denominator of 12:

1/3 = 4/12 (because 3 × 4 = 12, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 4)

1/4 = 3/12 (because 4 × 3 = 12, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 3)

Now add them together:

4/12 + 3/12 = (4+3)/12 = 7/12

**Example 4:** Subtract 2/3 - 1/6

The LCD of 3 and 6 is 6.

Convert 2/3 to have the denominator of 6:

2/3 = 4/6 (multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2)

Now subtract:

4/6 - 1/6 = (4-1)/6 = 3/6

And lastly, if possible, simplify the fraction:

3/6 can be reduced to 1/2 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 3.

## Multiplication of Fractions

To multiply fractions, simply multiply the numerators together and then the denominators.

**Example 5:** Multiply 1/3 × 1/2

Multiply the numerators: 1 × 1 = 1

Multiply the denominators: 3 × 2 = 6

So, 1/3 × 1/2 = 1/6.

## Division of Fractions

To divide fractions, flip the second fraction (the divisor) over so its numerator becomes its denominator and its denominator becomes its numerator. Then multiply the fractions.

**Example 6:** Divide 2/3 ÷ 1/4

Flip the second fraction: 1/4 becomes 4/1.

Then multiply: 2/3 × 4/1 = (2×4)/(3×1) = 8/3

Since 8/3 is an improper fraction (the numerator is larger than the denominator), you can also convert it into a mixed number, which is 2 2/3.

## Practice Exercises

Now that we've gone over the basics, let's practice these operations!

1. Add: 3/8 + 1/8
2. Subtract: 5/9 - 2/9
3. Add: 2/5 + 1/10
4. Subtract: 4/7 - 1/14
5. Multiply: 3/4 × 2/3
6. Divide: 5/6 ÷ 2/5

## Answers to Practice Exercises

1. 3/8 + 1/8 = (3+1)/8 = 4/8 which simplifies to 1/2.
2. 5/9 - 2/9 = (5-2)/9 = 3/9 which simplifies to 1/3.
3. 2/5 + 1/10 = 4/10 + 1/10 = (4+1)/10 = 5/10 which simplifies to 1/2.
4. 4/7 - 1/14 = 8/14 - 1/14 = (8-1)/14 = 7/14 which simplifies to 1/2.
5. 3/4 × 2/3 = (3×2)/(4×3) = 6/12 which simplifies to 1/2.
6. 5/6 ÷ 2/5 = 5/6 × 5/2 = (5×5)/(6×2) = 25/12 which is 2 1/12.

Remember, practice is key when working with fractions! The more you practice, the better you will become at performing these basic operations with fractions.
