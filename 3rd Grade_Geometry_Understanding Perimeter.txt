# Understanding Perimeter

## What is Perimeter?

In geometry, the perimeter is the distance all the way around a two-dimensional shape. You can think of it like the fence that surrounds a garden or the border around a picture. If we walked along the edges of a shape, from the starting point right around to the same point, the distance we covered would be the perimeter.

## How to Find Perimeter

To find the perimeter of a shape, we add up the lengths of all its sides. The perimeter is measured in units of length, such as meters, feet, or centimeters. Here's how you can calculate perimeter for a couple of common shapes:

- **Rectangle:** Since opposite sides of a rectangle are equal, the formula to find the perimeter is `P = 2(length + width)`.
  
- **Square:** All four sides of a square are equal, so the perimeter is four times the length of one side: `P = 4 × side`.

With shapes like circles, finding the perimeter is a little different. The perimeter of a circle is known as the circumference and is calculated using the circle's diameter and the mathematical constant π (pi). 

But, let's focus on some simpler shapes first.

## Exercise: Calculate the Perimeter

Here's an exercise to practice finding perimeters. Grab your ruler, and let's start!

1. **Rectangle**
   
   A garden in the shape of a rectangle measures 5 meters long and 3 meters wide. What is the perimeter of the garden?

   *Solution:*

   Use the formula for a rectangle: `P = 2(length + width)`

   So, `P = 2(5 m + 3 m) = 2 × 8 m = 16 m`

   The perimeter of the garden is 16 meters.

2. **Square**
   
   Alex has a square tablecloth, and each side is 2 feet long. What is the perimeter of the tablecloth?

   *Solution:*

   Use the formula for a square: `P = 4 × side`

   So, `P = 4 × 2 ft = 8 ft`

   The perimeter of the tablecloth is 8 feet.

3. **Triangle**
  
   A triangular banner has sides that are 4 inches, 5 inches, and 6 inches long. What is the perimeter of the banner?

   *Solution:*

   Add all the sides together: `P = side1 + side2 + side3`

   So, `P = 4 in + 5 in + 6 in = 15 in`

   The perimeter of the banner is 15 inches.

## Practice Problems

Now, it's your turn to calculate the perimeter on your own. Write down your answers, then check with the solutions below!

1. A rectangular pool is 7 yards long and 2 yards wide. Find the perimeter.

2. Emma has a square painting with each side measuring 1.5 meters. What is the perimeter of the painting?

3. A triangular sign has sides of 3 feet, 4 feet, and 5 feet. Calculate its perimeter.

## Solutions to Practice Problems

1. For the rectangular pool:

   `P = 2(length + width) = 2(7 yd + 2 yd) = 2 × 9 yd = 18 yd`

   The perimeter of the pool is 18 yards.

2. For Emma's square painting:

   `P = 4 × side = 4 × 1.5 m = 6 m`

   The perimeter of the painting is 6 meters.

3. For the triangular sign:

   `P = side1 + side2 + side3 = 3 ft + 4 ft + 5 ft = 12 ft`

   The perimeter of the triangular sign is 12 feet.

Remember that calculating the perimeter is just like taking a walk all the way around the edges of a shape and measuring that distance. Keep practicing, and soon you'll be a perimeter pro!
