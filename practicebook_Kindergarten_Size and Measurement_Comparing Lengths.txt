# Size and Measurement: Comparing Lengths

## Introduction to Comparing Lengths

Welcome to the "Comparing Lengths" section of our Math Practice Book! In this section, we will learn about different lengths and how to compare them. When we compare lengths, we are looking to see which object is longer, shorter, or if they are the same length. Understanding how to compare lengths is an important skill that will help you in many different kinds of measurements in the future.

## Learn: Shorter and Longer

**Shorter**: If one object can be placed on top of another and does not reach the other object's ends, then it is shorter.

**Longer**: If one object surpasses the length of another when placed on top of it or side by side, it is longer.

### Let's Practice!

**1.** Here we have a pencil and a crayon. Which is longer?

- [ ] Pencil
- [x] Crayon

**Answer:** Crayon is longer than the pencil.

**2.** Look at the two snakes. Which snake is shorter?

- [x] Snake A
- [ ] Snake B

**Answer:** Snake A is shorter than Snake B.

## Activity: Compare and Match

Draw a line to match the objects that are the same length.

**3.** A rubber band - A twig

**4.** A piece of string - A worm

**5.** A book - A notebook

**Answers:**

**3.** The rubber band matches with the twig.
**4.** The piece of string matches with the worm.
**5.** The book matches with the notebook.

## Exercise: Longer or Shorter?

Decide which object is longer or shorter and circle the correct answer.

**6.** A school bus or a bicycle?

- Longer: [x] School bus
- Shorter: [ ] Bicycle

**Answer:** The school bus is longer than the bicycle.

**7.** A new pencil or a pencil stub?

- Longer: [ ] New pencil
- Shorter: [x] Pencil stub

**Answer:** The pencil stub is shorter than the new pencil.

## Think and Write:

**8.** Measure your foot with a ruler and write down its length.

**9.** Find an object in your home that is shorter than your foot. What is it?

**10.** Find an object in your home that is longer than your foot. What is it?

**Answers:**

**8.** A student's foot might be around 7 inches long.

**9.** An object shorter than a student's foot could be a TV remote.

**10.** An object longer than a student's foot could be a floor mat.

## Review: Comparing Lengths

Great job learning about comparing lengths! Remember:

- To find out which is longer, line up objects at the same starting point.
- Comparing lengths can be done using objects in your surroundings.
- Knowing how to compare lengths will help you with bigger measurements.

Now that you've completed the exercises, try measuring and comparing objects around your home for more practice!
