## Understanding Perimeter

Welcome to the section on understanding perimeter! Perimeter is an important concept in geometry that refers to the distance around a two-dimensional shape. Imagine you are walking along the border of a garden or running around a soccer field â€“ the path you travel is similar to the shape's perimeter. We will explore how to find the perimeter of different shapes.

### What is Perimeter?

The perimeter of a shape is the total length of all its sides. To find the perimeter, you simply add up the lengths of all the sides.

### Perimeter of Rectangles and Squares

Since rectangles and squares have sides opposite to each other that are equal in length, calculating their perimeter is straightforward.

#### Rectangles

A rectangle has two pairs of equal sides. To find the perimeter of a rectangle, you can use the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

where \( P \) stands for perimeter, the length is the longer side of the rectangle, and the width is the shorter side.

**Exercise 1:**
Find the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 8 inches and a width of 3 inches.

**Answer:**
\[ P = 2 \times (8 + 3) = 2 \times 11 = 22 \text{ inches} \]

#### Squares

A square has four sides of equal length. To find the perimeter of a square, multiply the length of one side by 4.

\[ P = 4 \times side \]

**Exercise 2:**
Calculate the perimeter of a square whose side is 5 inches long.

**Answer:**
\[ P = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ inches} \]

### Perimeter of Triangles

The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides.

**Exercise 3:**
Find the perimeter of a triangle with side lengths of 4 inches, 5 inches, and 6 inches.

**Answer:**
\[ P = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \text{ inches} \]

### Perimeter of Regular Polygons

A regular polygon is a shape where all the sides and angles are the same. The formula to find the perimeter is:

\[ P = number \: of \: sides \times length \: of \: one \: side \]

**Exercise 4:**
Calculate the perimeter of a regular hexagon (a six-sided polygon) with each side measuring 3 inches.

**Answer:**
\[ P = 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ inches} \]

### Practice Problems

Let's work on some exercises to practice finding perimeters. Remember, add up all the side lengths of the shape to find the perimeter!

1. Find the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 7 meters and a width of 2 meters.
   
   **Answer:** \( P = 2 \times (7 + 2) = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ meters} \)

2. A square garden has a side length of 12 feet. What is its perimeter?
   
   **Answer:** \( P = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ feet} \)

3. Find the perimeter of a triangle with sides of 7 inches, 8 inches, and 9 inches.
   
   **Answer:** \( P = 7 + 8 + 9 = 24 \text{ inches} \)

4. Calculate the perimeter of a regular octagon (an eight-sided polygon) with each side measuring 5 centimeters.
   
   **Answer:** \( P = 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ centimeters} \)

5. Your classroom's rectangular door measures 80 centimeters wide and 200 centimeters high. What is the perimeter of the door?
   
   **Answer:** \( P = 2 \times (80 + 200) = 2 \times 280 = 560 \text{ centimeters} \)

### Real-World Applications

Understanding how to calculate perimeter can be useful in real life! For example, if you want to build a fence around your garden to keep rabbits out, knowing the perimeter will tell you how much fencing material you'll need.

### Review

Remember, the perimeter is the total distance around the edge of a shape. You can find it by adding together the lengths of all the sides. For rectangles and squares, you can use a formula based on the lengths of the sides. For triangles and other polygons, simply add up the lengths of each side.

Now that you've learned about perimeter, continue to practice with different shapes, and you'll be a perimeter pro in no time!
