## Adding and Subtracting Fractions

Welcome to the section on adding and subtracting fractions! This is an important skill in math, and once you understand the basics, you'll be able to solve these kinds of problems with ease. Let's get started!

### Understanding Fractions

Before we jump into adding and subtracting, let's quickly review what a fraction is. A fraction consists of a numerator (the top number) and a denominator (the bottom number). The numerator tells us how many parts we have, and the denominator tells us how many equal parts the whole is divided into.

### Like Fractions

When the denominators of fractions are the same, we call these "like fractions." 

#### Adding Like Fractions

To add like fractions, follow these steps:

1. Keep the denominator the same.
2. Add the numerators.
3. Simplify the fraction if possible.

**Example 1:**
Add 1/4 + 2/4

**Solution 1:**
1/4 + 2/4 = (1 + 2)/4 = 3/4

**Answer 1:**
3/4

#### Subtracting Like Fractions

Subtracting like fractions is similar to adding.

1. Keep the denominator the same.
2. Subtract the numerators.
3. Simplify the fraction if possible.

**Example 2:**
Subtract 3/8 - 1/8

**Solution 2:**
3/8 - 1/8 = (3 - 1)/8 = 2/8

Now, simplify 2/8 to 1/4.

**Answer 2:**
1/4

### Unlike Fractions

When fractions have different denominators, we call these "unlike fractions." Before you can add or subtract unlike fractions, you need to find a common denominator.

#### Finding a Common Denominator

To find a common denominator:

1. List multiples of each denominator.
2. Find the least common multiple (LCM) that is shared between them.
3. Convert the fractions to equivalent fractions with the LCM as the new denominator.

**Example 3:**
Find a common denominator for 1/3 and 2/5.

**Solution 3:**
Multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27...
Multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35...

The LCM is 15.

**Answer 3:**
The common denominator is 15.

#### Adding Unlike Fractions

Once you have the same denominator, you can add the fractions.

1. Convert to equivalent fractions using the common denominator.
2. Add the numerators.
3. Keep the new denominator the same.
4. Simplify if necessary.

**Example 4:**
Add 1/3 + 2/5 with 15 as the common denominator.

**Solution 4:**
1/3 = 5/15 (since 1 * 5 = 5 and 3 * 5 = 15)
2/5 = 6/15 (since 2 * 3 = 6 and 5 * 3 = 15)

Now, add 5/15 + 6/15 = (5 + 6)/15 = 11/15

**Answer 4:**
11/15

#### Subtracting Unlike Fractions

The process for subtracting is similar to adding once you have the common denominator.

1. Convert to equivalent fractions with the common denominator.
2. Subtract the numerators.
3. Keep the new denominator the same.
4. Simplify if necessary.

**Example 5:**
Subtract 2/3 from 4/5 with 15 as the common denominator.

**Solution 5:**
2/3 = 10/15 (since 2 * 5 = 10 and 3 * 5 = 15)
4/5 = 12/15 (since 4 * 3 = 12 and 5 * 3 = 15)

Now, subtract 12/15 - 10/15 = (12 - 10)/15 = 2/15

**Answer 5:**
2/15

### Practice Problems

Solve the following problems. The answers are provided so you can check your work!

1. Add 1/6 + 1/6
   **Answer:** 2/6, simplified to 1/3
2. Subtract 5/9 - 2/9
   **Answer:** 3/9, simplified to 1/3
3. Add 3/7 + 1/14
   **Answer:** 5/14
4. Subtract 4/11 from 9/22
   **Answer:** 1/22
5. Add 2/8 + 3/4
   **Answer:** 1

Remember, the keys to adding and subtracting fractions are finding a common denominator and ensuring that you simplify your answers whenever possible. Practice these steps and you'll master fractions in no time!
