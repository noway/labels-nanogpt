# Money Matters – Simple Buying and Selling Concepts

Welcome to the "Simple Buying and Selling Concepts" section of your 1st Grade Math Practice Book! In this section, we will learn some basic ideas about how money is used to buy and sell things. Money is used every day to get goods (which are things you can hold, like toys and food) and services (which are tasks someone does for you, like haircuts or car washes).

## What is Money?

Money can be coins, like pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters, or paper bills, like 1 dollar or 5 dollars. We use money to pay for things we want or need.

## Exercise 1 - Identifying Coins and Bills

Identify each coin or bill. Write its value below it.

1. This is a penny. It is worth 1 cent. ✅
2. This is a nickel. It is worth 5 cents. ✅
3. This is a dime. It is worth 10 cents. ✅
4. This is a quarter. It is worth 25 cents. ✅
5. This is a 1 dollar bill. It is worth 100 cents, or $1. ✅
6. This is a 5 dollar bill. It is worth 500 cents, or $5. ✅

## Exercise 2 - Counting Money

Count the money shown in the picture and write the total amount.

1. 2 quarters, 1 dime, and 3 pennies = $0.63 ✅
2. 1 dollar bill and 2 nickels = $1.10 ✅
3. 4 dimes and 5 pennies = $0.45 ✅
4. 1 five-dollar bill, 1 quarter, and 2 dimes = $5.45 ✅

## Exercise 3 - Making a Purchase

Match the amount of money you have to the price of the item. Can you buy it?

1. You have: $1.00, Item costs: $0.75 – Yes, you can buy it! ✅
2. You have: $0.50, Item costs: $0.65 – No, you don't have enough money. ❌
3. You have: $5.00, Item costs: $4.25 – Yes, you can buy it! ✅
4. You have: $2.00, Item costs: $1.99 – Yes, you can buy it! ✅

## Exercise 4 - Counting Change

If you buy an item, how much change will you get back? Subtract the price from the amount you have to find out.

1. You have: $1.00, Item costs: $0.65, Change: $0.35 ✅
2. You have: $5.00, Item costs: $3.50, Change: $1.50 ✅
3. You have: $10.00, Item costs: $7.25, Change: $2.75 ✅
4. You have: $2.00, Item costs: $1.75, Change: $0.25 ✅

## Exercise 5 - Role-playing Buying and Selling

Pretend you are the shopkeeper or the customer. Practice buying and selling with a friend or family member. Use play money or draw your own!

**Example 1:**

Customer: "I would like to buy this pencil case."
Shopkeeper: "Sure, that will be $1.50."
Customer: "Here is a 2 dollar bill."
Shopkeeper: "Thank you. Here is your change, 50 cents."

**Example 2:**

Customer: "Can I have this toy car?"
Shopkeeper: "Of course! It's $3.75."
Customer: "Here's a five-dollar bill."
Shopkeeper: "Great, I'll give you back $1.25."
