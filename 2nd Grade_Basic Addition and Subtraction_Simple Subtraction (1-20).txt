# Basic Addition and Subtraction

## Simple Subtraction (1-20)

Subtraction is an essential mathematic skill that second graders need to learn. It is the process of taking away one number from another to find out how many are left. When we subtract, we are finding the difference between two numbers. Let's learn how to subtract with numbers from 1 to 20!

### Understanding Subtraction

Before we begin subtracting, let's familiarize ourselves with some terms:

- **Minuend:** The number we are subtracting from. (Example: In 8 - 3 = 5, 8 is the minuend.)
- **Subtrahend:** The number we are subtracting. (Example: In 8 - 3 = 5, 3 is the subtrahend.)
- **Difference:** The result after subtracting one number from another. (Example: In 8 - 3 = 5, 5 is the difference.)

### How to Subtract

1. Start with the larger number (minuend).
2. Take away the smaller number (subtrahend) from the larger number.
3. Count how much is left to find the difference.

### Tips for Subtraction

- Always start with the larger number.
- Use your fingers, counters, or draw pictures to help you visualize the subtraction.
- Practice makes perfect!

### Example Exercises:

Let's try some subtraction problems! Remember to subtract the smaller number from the larger one.

1. **7 - 4 = ?**

   To find the answer, start with 7 and count backwards 4 times: 7, 6, 5, 4, 3. 

   **Answer: 3**

2. **9 - 5 = ?**

   Start with 9 and count backwards 5 times: 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4.

   **Answer: 4**

3. **15 - 6 = ?**

   Starting with 15, count backwards 6 times: 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9.

   **Answer: 9**

4. **12 - 8 = ?**

   Begin with 12 and count backwards 8 times: 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4.

   **Answer: 4**

5. **18 - 9 = ?**

   Start with 18 and count backwards 9 times: 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10.

   **Answer: 9**

### Practice Problems:

Now, try these on your own!

A. **14 - 7 = ?**

B. **16 - 3 = ?**

C. **20 - 11 = ?**

D. **10 - 10 = ?**

E. **19 - 14 = ?**

### Answers to Practice Problems:

A. **14 - 7 = 7**

To find the answer, start with 14. If we count backwards 7 times, we'll get 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7. So, the difference is 7.

B. **16 - 3 = 13**

Begin with 16 and count backwards 3 times: 16, 15, 14, 13. The difference is 13.

C. **20 - 11 = 9**

Start with the largest number 20. Count backwards 11 times: 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9. The difference is 9.

D. **10 - 10 = 0**

If we start with 10 and subtract all 10, there are none left. The difference is 0.

E. **19 - 14 = 5**

Finally, start with 19 and count backwards 14 times: 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5. The difference is 5.

Great job! You're getting better at subtraction. Remember, with practice, subtraction will become easier and faster. Don't give up, keep practicing, and soon you'll be subtracting like a pro!
