# Subtracting Numbers up to 10

Welcome to the world of subtraction, little mathematicians! Subtraction is just like taking some things away from a group, and then seeing how many things you have left. Imagine you have a bunch of apples or your favorite toys in front of you and someone asks to borrow a few. After you give them away, you count what's left â€” that's subtraction!

**Let's Learn About Subtraction!**

Subtraction is when we take away one number from another. We use a special sign for subtraction, and it looks like this: -

For example:

If you have **5** candies and you eat **2**, you can use subtraction to find out how many candies you will have left.

**5 - 2 = 3**

So, you will have **3** candies left after you eat **2**.

**How to Subtract:**

Subtraction is like counting backwards! Check out these simple steps:
1. Start with the first number.
2. Count back as many times as the second number says.
3. The number you end on is your answer!

Let's try another one:

If you start with **7** balloons and **4** fly away, how many do you have left?

**7 - 4 = 3**

You have **3** balloons left.

Now, let's make some subtraction stories and solve them together!

**Subtraction Story Exercises:**

1. **Story 1:**
   There are **8** ducks at the pond, but then **5** of them decide to swim away. How many ducks are left at the pond?
   
   **8 - 5 = ?**
   
   **Answer:** There are **3** ducks left at the pond.

2. **Story 2:**
   Emma has **10** pencils. She gives **4** pencils to her friend. How many pencils does Emma have now?
   
   **10 - 4 = ?**
   
   **Answer:** Emma has **6** pencils now.

3. **Story 3:**
   There are **9** cookies in the jar. Alex eats **6** cookies after lunch. How many cookies are left in the jar?
   
   **9 - 6 = ?**
   
   **Answer:** There are **3** cookies left in the jar.

**Practice Problems:**

Now that you have seen how it is done, it's your turn! Try to solve these subtraction problems and check your answers afterward.

A. **6 - 3 = ?**
   
B. **5 - 5 = ?**
   
C. **7 - 2 = ?**
   
D. **4 - 4 = ?**
   
E. **10 - 7 = ?**

**Answers to Practice Problems:**

A. **6 - 3 = 3**
   
B. **5 - 5 = 0**
   
C. **7 - 2 = 5**
   
D. **4 - 4 = 0**
   
E. **10 - 7 = 3**

**Remember These Fun Facts:**

- When you subtract a number from itself, the answer is always **0**. Like **5 - 5 = 0**.
- When we don't subtract anything at all, the number stays the same! Like **6 - 0 = 6**.

**Great Job!**

You've done an amazing job learning how to subtract numbers up to 10. Keep practicing and soon you'll be a subtraction superstar. Remember, subtraction helps us find out 'how many are left' or 'how many more' and is a handy tool in many areas of life.

Look out for more adventures in math as you continue to grow and learn. Until then, keep counting and subtracting, my friends!
