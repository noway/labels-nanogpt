# Logical Reasoning and Patterns

#### Understanding Patterns

Patterns are a way that numbers, shapes, or ideas are repeated. Recognizing and following patterns help us predict what will come next. We use patterns a lot in math! 

**Example**: 

Can you see the pattern here?

ðŸ”µðŸ”´ðŸ”µðŸ”´ðŸ”µðŸ”´

What would be the next two shapes in the sequence?

**Answer**: The pattern is a blue circle followed by a red circle and it repeats. The next two shapes would be ðŸ”µðŸ”´.

#### Patterns with Numbers

Numbers can also form patterns. We can add, subtract, multiply, or divide to continue a number pattern.

**Example 1**: 

Fill in the blanks:

2, 4, 6, _, _, 12

What are we doing to continue the pattern?

**Answer 1**: We are adding 2 each time. So, the blanks should be filled with 8 and 10 to continue the pattern: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12.

**Example 2**:

What comes next in this pattern?

5, 10, 20, 40, __

**Answer 2**: We are doubling the number each time. After 40, we double it to get 80.

#### Finding the Rule in Patterns

Sometimes, patterns can be a little tricky. It's like a secret code that we have to figure out. Once we know the rule, we can crack the code!

**Example**:

Look at this pattern and find the rule:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, __

What's happening each time?

**Answer**: We are adding one more than we did the last time. So, we start by adding 2: 

1+2=3

Next, add 3:

3+3=6

Then add 4:

6+4=10

Lastly, add 5:

10+5=15

For our next number, we need to add 6:

15+6=21

The rule is to add one more than the last time.

#### Logical Reasoning Problems

Logical reasoning is when you use the information you have to figure out something new. Letâ€™s try a few problems that require us to think logically!

**Example 1**:

There are 5 dogs in the yard. Each dog has 4 legs. How many legs are in the yard?

**Answer 1**: 

Each dog has 4 legs, so we need to multiply the number of dogs (5) by the number of legs on one dog (4). 

5 dogs x 4 legs = 20 legs

**Example 2**:

I am thinking of a number. The number is more than 10 but less than 15. It is also an even number. What is my number?

**Answer 2**: 

Letâ€™s list the even numbers between 10 and 15: 12, 14. Both numbers are even, and they are between 10 and 15. But since the number is "more than 10", the only number that fits all the information is 12.

#### Exercises

**Exercise 1**: 

Find the next two numbers in the pattern: 

3, 6, 9, 12, __, __

**Answer to Exercise 1**: 

We are adding 3 each time to get the next number. 

12+3=15

15+3=18

So, the next two numbers are 15, 18.

**Exercise 2**:

If there are 3 bicycles and each bicycle has 2 wheels, how many wheels are there in total?

**Answer to Exercise 2**: 

Bicycles have 2 wheels each. So we multiply the number of bicycles (3) by the number of wheels on one bicycle (2). 

3 bicycles x 2 wheels = 6 wheels

**Exercise 3**:

What comes next?

ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ¦ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ¦ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¥__ 

**Answer to Exercise 3**: 

The pattern is a sequence of red (ðŸŸ¥), blue (ðŸŸ¦), and green (ðŸŸ©) squares. After red (ðŸŸ¥), the next color in the pattern should be blue (ðŸŸ¦).

Remember, practice helps you get better at recognizing patterns and using logical reasoning. Keep practicing, and youâ€™ll be a pattern pro in no time!
