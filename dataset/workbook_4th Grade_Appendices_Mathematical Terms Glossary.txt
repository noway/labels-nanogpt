## Mathematical Terms Glossary

**Addend**: A number that is added to another number. For example, in the sum 3 + 4 = 7, both 3 and 4 are addends.

**Angle**: The space (measured in degrees) between two intersecting lines or surfaces at the point where they meet.

**Area**: The amount of space inside the boundary of a flat (2-dimensional) object such as a triangle or rectangle. For instance, the area of a rectangle is calculated as length × width.

**Array**: A set of numbers or objects that follow a specific pattern, often arranged in rows and columns to show multiplication concepts.

**Average (Mean)**: A number that represents the central or typical value in a set of data. It is calculated by adding all the numbers together and then dividing by the count of numbers.

**Bar Graph**: A chart with bars whose lengths are proportional to quantities. It is used for comparing different values or categories.

**Base (of a power)**: The number that is going to be raised to a power. For example, in 2^3, the base is 2.

**Circumference**: The distance around the edge of a circle. It is calculated as π (pi) times the diameter of the circle (C = πd).

**Common Denominator**: A common multiple of the denominators of two or more fractions. It is used to compare or add fractions that have different denominators.

**Composite Number**: A whole number that has more than two factors. For example, 8 is a composite number because its factors are 1, 2, 4, and 8.

**Coordinate Plane (Cartesian Plane)**: A plane with a horizontal number line (x-axis) and a vertical number line (y-axis) used to locate points.

**Denominator**: The number below the line in a fraction, which indicates the total number of equal parts the whole is divided into.

**Difference**: The result of subtracting one number from another. How much one number differs from another.

**Division**: An operation that determines how many times one number contains another. It is the opposite of multiplication.

**Equation**: A mathematical sentence that shows that two expressions are equal. It contains an equal sign (=).

**Exponent (power)**: A number that indicates how many times the base is multiplied by itself. For example, in 2^3, the number 3 is the exponent.

**Factor**: A whole number that divides evenly into another number. For example, the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.

**Fraction**: A way to describe a part of a whole or a part of a group by using two numbers, the numerator over the denominator.

**Function**: A relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs where each input is related to exactly one output.

**Geometry**: A branch of mathematics that deals with the properties, measurement, and relationships of points, lines, angles, surfaces, and solids.

**Greater Than (>)/ Less Than (<)**: Symbols used to compare two numbers or expressions. > means the first number is larger; < means the first number is smaller.

**Improper Fraction**: A fraction whose numerator is larger than or equal to its denominator, such as 7/4.

**Intercept**: The point where a line crosses the x-axis or y-axis on a coordinate plane.

**Interval**: The difference between two numbers on the scale of a graph or the distance between two points.

**Line Graph**: A type of chart used to show information that changes over time.

**Median**: The middle number in a set of numbers arranged in order.

**Mixed Number**: A whole number and a fraction combined into one "mixed" number, such as 1 3/4.

**Mode**: The number that occurs most frequently in a given set of numbers.

**Multiple**: A number that can be divided by another number without leaving a remainder. For example, 15 is a multiple of 5.

**Numerator**: The number above the line in a fraction that indicates how many parts of the whole are being considered.

**Operation**: A mathematical process such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

**Order of Operations**: A set of rules that dictates the sequence in which operations should be performed to correctly solve an expression (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

**Parallel**: Lines in the same plane that do not intersect, no matter how far they are extended.

**Percent**: A ratio that compares a number to 100, symbolized by the % sign.

**Perimeter**: The distance around the outside of a polygon. This is the sum of the lengths of all the sides.

**Perpendicular**: Lines that intersect to form a right angle (90 degrees).

**Pi (π)**: An irrational number approximately equal to 3.14159 used to calculate the circumference and area of circles.

**Place Value**: The value of the place, or position, that a digit holds in a number.

**Prime Number**: A whole number greater than 1 that has exactly two factors, 1 and itself.

**Product**: The result of multiplying two or more numbers.

**Proportion**: An equation stating that two ratios are equal.

**Quadrilateral**: A polygon with four sides.

**Quotient**: The result of division.

**Range**: The difference between the highest and lowest values in a set of numbers.

**Ratio**: A comparison of two quantities by division.

**Rectangle**: A quadrilateral with four right angles.

**Rounding**: Reducing a number to a shorter or simpler number that is approximately equal to the original number.

**Square**: A rectangle with all four sides of equal length.

**Sum**: The result of adding two or more numbers.

**Symmetry**: When two parts of a whole are identical or similar in shape and size.

**Variable**: A symbol, usually a letter, used to represent a number in mathematical expressions or equations.

**Vertex (Vertices)**: The corner point of a polygon or angle where two or more lines meet.

**Volume**: The amount of space a 3-dimensional object occupies. For example, the volume of a rectangular prism is calculated as length × width × height.

**Whole Number**: The set of numbers that include zero and all positive numbers without fractions or decimals.

**X-axis**: The horizontal number line in a coordinate plane.

**Y-axis**: The vertical number line in a coordinate plane.
