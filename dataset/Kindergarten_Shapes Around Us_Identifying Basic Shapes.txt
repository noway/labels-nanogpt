# Chapter: Shapes Around Us

#### Section 2.1: Identifying Basic Shapes

Welcome, students! Have you ever looked around and noticed that everything has a shape? From the wheels on a bus to the slice of cheese in your sandwich, shapes are everywhere! Let's learn about the basic shapes that you can find in the world around you.

#### What is a Shape?

A shape is the form of an object. When we talk about shapes, we're talking about how something looks on the outside. Shapes can have sides (like a square or a rectangle) or be round and curvy (like a circle).

#### Meet the Basics

There are a few simple shapes that we see all the time. Let's meet each one:

1. **Circle**: A round shape with no corners or sides.
2. **Square**: A shape with four equal sides and four corners.
3. **Rectangle**: Like a square, but with two long sides and two short sides.
4. **Triangle**: A shape with three sides and three corners.

#### Fun Facts!
- Every square is a rectangle, but not every rectangle is a square.
- A circle is the only shape that goes round and round without any corners.

#### Exercise: Shape Hunt!

Take a walk around your room or house and see if you can find these shapes. Write down what objects match the shapes.

1. Circle:
2. Square:
3. Rectangle:
4. Triangle:

**Example Answers:**
1. Circle: A clock, a plate, or a coin.
2. Square: A window, a napkin, or a tile on the floor.
3. Rectangle: A book, a door, or a smartphone.
4. Triangle: A slice of pizza, a yield traffic sign, or a hanger.

#### Draw Your Shapes

Next, let's draw our shapes. Grab some crayons and follow these steps:

1. Circle: Start at one point and make a curvy line that comes all the way back to where you started.
2. Square: Draw a straight line. At the end of this line, make a turn and draw another line the same length. Do this two more times until you have a closed shape with four equal sides.
3. Rectangle: Just like a square, but make two lines longer than the other two.
4. Triangle: Three lines are all you need. Start with one, then add two more lines, one at a time, that come back to the first line.

#### Practice Problems

**Problem 1:** Draw a circle around the square objects and a square around the circle objects in the picture below.
_(Accompanying the text, there would be a group of various shape objects to which students can respond.)_

**Problem 2:** What shape is your computer or TV screen? Draw it here!

**Answer 1:** Students circle items like picture frames and tile squares, and square around items like clocks and wheels.

**Answer 2:** A rectangle. Students should draw a rectangle to represent their screen.

#### Fun Activity: Create a Shape Collage!

Using construction paper, scissors, and glue, cut out the shapes we've learned and create a collage. 

Materials:
- Construction paper
- Scissors (ask for help from a grown-up!)
- Glue or glue stick
- Markers or crayons

1. Trace circles, squares, rectangles, and triangles on construction paper.
2. Carefully cut out the shapes.
3. Arrange your shapes on a piece of paper to make a fun picture.
4. When you're happy with your collage, glue the shapes down.

#### Review Questions

1. How many sides does a triangle have?
2. Is every square a rectangle? Why or why not?
3. Look at the wheel of a car. What shape is it?

#### Review Answers

1. A triangle has 3 sides.
2. Yes, every square is a rectangle because it has four sides and every angle is a right angle. However, a rectangle has two sides longer than the other two, which makes it different from a square.
3. The wheel of a car is a circle.

#### Congratulations!

You've now learned about the basic shapes. Remember to always keep an eye out for circles, squares, rectangles, and triangles all around you. They are the building blocks of so many things you see every day. Keep practicing, and soon you'll be a shape expert!
