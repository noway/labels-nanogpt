## Area and Perimeter

### Understanding Area
The area is the size of a surface. It tells us how much space is inside a shape. We measure area in square units, like square inches (in²), square feet (ft²), square centimeters (cm²), or square meters (m²).

### How to Calculate Area

#### Rectangle
To find the area of a rectangle, you multiply the length by the width.

**Formula: Area = Length × Width**

**Example:** 
If the length of a rectangle is 4 inches and the width is 3 inches, what is its area?
Area = 4 in × 3 in = 12 in²

#### Square
Since all sides of a square are equal, the area of a square is the length of one side squared.

**Formula: Area = Side × Side**

**Example:**
If one side of a square is 5 inches, what is its area?
Area = 5 in × 5 in = 25 in²

### Understanding Perimeter
The perimeter is the distance around the outside of a shape.

### How to Calculate Perimeter

#### Rectangle
To find the perimeter of a rectangle, you add up the lengths of all four sides.

**Formula: Perimeter = (Length + Width) × 2**

**Example:**
If a rectangle has a length of 6 inches and a width of 2 inches, what is its perimeter?
Perimeter = (6 in + 2 in) × 2 = 16 in

#### Square
For a square, you can multiply one side by 4 to get the perimeter.

**Formula: Perimeter = Side × 4**

**Example:**
If one side of a square is 3 inches, what is its perimeter?
Perimeter = 3 in × 4 = 12 in

### Practice Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Area of a Rectangle
Find the area of a rectangle with a length of 8 feet and a width of 5 feet.

**Answer:**
8 ft × 5 ft = 40 ft²
The area of the rectangle is 40 square feet.

#### Exercise 2: Perimeter of a Rectangle
What is the perimeter of the same rectangle in Exercise 1?

**Answer:**
(8 ft + 5 ft) × 2 = 26 ft
The perimeter of the rectangle is 26 feet.

#### Exercise 3: Area of a Square
Calculate the area of a square with a side length of 7 centimeters.

**Answer:**
7 cm × 7 cm = 49 cm²
The area of the square is 49 square centimeters.

#### Exercise 4: Perimeter of a Square
Find the perimeter of the same square in Exercise 3.

**Answer:**
7 cm × 4 = 28 cm
The perimeter of the square is 28 centimeters.

#### Exercise 5: Composite Shapes
Patrick's garden has the shape of a large rectangle that is 20 feet long and 10 feet wide, but there is a square sandbox on one end that is 5 feet on each side. What is the area of the garden not including the sandbox?

**Answer:**
First, find the area of the whole garden:
Area of the garden = 20 ft × 10 ft = 200 ft²
Next, find the area of the sandbox:
Area of the sandbox = 5 ft × 5 ft = 25 ft²
Now, subtract the sandbox area from the garden area:
200 ft² - 25 ft² = 175 ft²
The area of the garden, excluding the sandbox, is 175 square feet.
