# Introduction to Addition

---

Welcome to the beginning of your adventure in math! Today, we are going to learn about a very important math skill called __Addition__. Do you know that when you put things together, you end up with more? That’s what addition is all about!

**What is Addition?**

Addition is when you put two or more numbers together to make a bigger number. It's just like when you have some apples and you get more apples from a friend, then you have even more apples to munch!

**Let’s Try It Out!**

Exercise 1: Combine the Groups

Here you have one group of objects and another group. Count how many there are in each group, then combine them to see how many there are together!

1. 🍎 + 🍎 = __2 apples__
2. 🚗 + 🚗 + 🚗 = __3 cars__
3. 🐱 + 🐱 + 🐱 + 🐱 = __4 cats__
4. 🏀 + 🏀 + 🏀 + 🏀 + 🏀 = __5 basketballs__

Did you count them? When we put them together, we are doing addition!

Exercise 2: Using Numbers

Now, let's use numbers to add. We'll take two numbers, count out that many objects, and then see how many we have when we put them together.

1. 1 + 2 = __3__
2. 2 + 1 = __3__ (It’s the same as the one above! Order doesn't matter in addition.)
3. 2 + 3 = __5__
4. 3 + 2 = __5__ (This is just like number 3. Did you notice they are switched but still make the same number?)
5. 4 + 1 = __5__
6. 5 + 0 = __5__ (Adding zero means it stays the same!)

Great job! You just added numbers all by yourself!

Exercise 3: Let’s Draw and Add!

Sometimes, drawing things can help us with adding. Draw circles to represent each number, and then count all the circles together to find your answer.

1. 1 + 3 = Draw 1 circle + Draw 3 circles = Count all circles = __4 circles__
2. 3 + 1 = Draw 3 circles + Draw 1 circle = Count all circles = __4 circles__
3. 2 + 2 = Draw 2 circles + Draw 2 circles = Count all circles = __4 circles__
4. 4 + 0 = Draw 4 circles + Draw 0 circles = Count all circles = __4 circles__

How did your drawings look? Did it help to see the addition by drawing it out? Awesome work!

**What Have We Learned?**

- Addition means putting two or more things together to find out how many there are in total.
- When we add numbers, the order doesn't matter – it's called the Commutative Property of Addition (that's a fancy way of saying 1 + 2 is the same as 2 + 1).
- We can use objects, drawings, or numbers to help us add things together.
- Adding zero to a number doesn't change the number. It stays the same!

Practice these exercises until you feel comfortable with addition. Remember, math is like a puzzle, and every time you practice, you're putting another piece in place! Keep up the good work, and you'll be an addition expert in no time.
