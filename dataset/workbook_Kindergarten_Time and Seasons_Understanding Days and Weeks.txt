#### Weeks in a Month

A week is like a building block for our month. Most months have about 4 weeks in them, but some can have a little more. The weeks help us count up to the big number of days in a month.

**Activity 4:** If there are 7 days in a week, how many days are there in 4 weeks?

**Answer to Activity 4:** In 4 weeks, there are 28 days (7 days x 4 weeks = 28 days).

#### Learning Tip!

Remembering the days of the week can be fun with a song. Try singing them to the tune of a familiar melody, like "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star." Ask your teacher or parent to help you find a days of the week song!

#### Practice Makes Perfect

The more you talk about the days and weeks, the easier it will be to remember them. Try using them in sentences, like:

- Today is Monday.
- My swimming lessons are on Thursday.
- Saturday and Sunday are the weekends.

**Activity 5:** Fill in the blank with the day that comes after the one given.
