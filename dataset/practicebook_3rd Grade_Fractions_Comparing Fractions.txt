## Section: Comparing Fractions

### Introduction

Understanding and comparing fractions is an essential skill in mathematics that third graders need to master. Fractions represent parts of a whole, and being able to compare these parts helps us solve real-world problems. In this section, we will learn how to determine whether fractions are greater than, less than, or equal to other fractions. 

We can compare fractions through:

1. **Comparing to Half:** Determining if fractions are more or less than 1/2.
2. **Finding Common Denominators:** Making the denominators the same so the numerators can be directly compared.
3. **Comparing Numerators with Same Denominators:** If the denominators are already the same, we compare numerators.
4. **Using Benchmarks:** Comparing fractions to known benchmarks such as 0, 1/2, and 1.
5. **Cross-Multiplication:** A technique used for comparing fractions with different numerators and denominators.

### Exercises

Before we begin, remember this key point:

- If fractions have the **same denominator**, compare the numerators.
- If fractions have the **different denominators**, find a common denominator or use other strategies to compare them.

#### Comparing to Half
When a denominator is even, 1/2 of the denominator will tell us the fraction that is equivalent to 1/2. If the numerator is less than this number, the fraction is less than 1/2. If it's more, it's greater than 1/2. 
For example, for the fraction 3/8, since 8/2 = 4, 3 is less than 4, so 3/8 is less than 1/2.

Practice Problems:
1. Which is greater, 3/4 or 1/2?
2. Which is less, 2/6 or 1/2?

Answers:
1. 3/4 is greater than 1/2 because 4/2 = 2 and 3 is greater than 2.
2. 2/6 is less than 1/2 because 6/2 = 3 and 2 is less than 3.

#### Finding Common Denominators
To compare fractions like 1/4 and 3/8, we need a common denominator. The smallest common denominator for 4 and 8 is 8. Convert 1/4 to 2/8, so that both fractions have the same denominator. Then, you can compare the numerators.

Practice Problems:
1. Compare 1/3 to 2/6.
2. Compare 3/5 to 2/4.

Answers:
1. 1/3 is equal to 2/6 because when you convert 1/3 to have a denominator of 6, it becomes 2/6.
2. To compare 3/5 and 2/4, we need a common denominator. The smallest one is 20. So, 3/5 becomes 12/20 and 2/4 becomes 10/20. Therefore, 3/5 (12/20) is greater than 2/4 (10/20).

#### Comparing Numerators with Same Denominators
When fractions have the same denominator, we look at the numerators; the larger numerator means the larger fraction.

Practice Problems:
1. Which is larger, 5/9 or 4/9?
2. Which is smaller, 7/10 or 9/10?

Answers:
1. 5/9 is greater than 4/9 because 5 is greater than 4.
2. 7/10 is less than 9/10 because 7 is less than 9.

#### Using Benchmarks
You can also compare fractions by placing them on a number line or comparing them to benchmarks like 0, 1/2, or 1.

Practice Problems:
1. Is 5/8 closer to 0, 1/2, or 1?
2. Is 2/7 closer to 0, 1/2, or 1?

Answers:
1. 5/8 is closer to 1/2 because it is more than 4/8, which is 1/2.
2. 2/7 is closer to 0 because it is less than 3.5/7, which would be 1/2.

#### Cross-Multiplication
If you have two fractions with different numerators and denominators, you can compare them by cross-multiplying. Greater cross-product means a greater fraction.

Practice Problems:
1. Compare 2/5 and 3/7.
2. Compare 5/8 and 4/7.

Answers:
1. For 2/5 and 3/7, cross multiply to get 14 (2*7) and 15 (3*5). Since 14 is less than 15, 2/5 is less than 3/7.
2. For 5/8 and 4/7, cross multiply to get 35 (5*7) and 32 (4*8). Since 35 is greater than 32, 5/8 is greater than 4/7.

### Review Questions

Practice comparing these fractions using any method you prefer. Write down which fraction is greater for each pair.

1. 3/4 vs 2/3
2. 1/2 vs 4/8
3. 6/9 vs 4/6
4. 7/12 vs 2/5
5. 3/7 vs 5/9

Review Answers:

1. 3/4 vs 2/3: Cross-multiply to get 9 (3*3) and 8 (2*4), so 3/4 is greater.
2. 1/2 vs 4/8: They are equal, because 4/8 simplifies to 1/2.
3. 6/9 vs 4/6: Simplify both fractions. 6/9 simplifies to 2/3, and 4/6 simplifies to 2/3, so they are equal.
4. 7/12 vs 2/5: Convert both to have a common denominator of 60. 7/12 becomes 35/60 and 2/5 becomes 24/60, so 7/12 is greater.
5. 3/7 vs 5/9: Convert both to have a common denominator of 63. 3/7 becomes 27/63 and 5/9 becomes 35/63, so 5/9 is greater.

### Conclusion

Comparing fractions is an important skill that can be approached using several different methods. The key is to look for patterns, apply the appropriate technique, and practice regularly to build confidence in solving these types of problems. With continued practice, comparing fractions will become an easy and manageable task.
