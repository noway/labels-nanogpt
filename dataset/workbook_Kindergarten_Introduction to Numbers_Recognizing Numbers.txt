# Chapter: Introduction to Numbers
**Section: Recognizing Numbers 0-10**

**Introduction:**
Welcome to our journey into the world of numbers! Recognizing numbers is an essential first step in learning mathematics. It's like getting to know the letters before you start reading words and sentences. Numbers are the building blocks of math, and being able to identify them is the foundation of counting, adding, subtracting, and much more.

In this section, we'll explore numbers 0 through 10. You'll get to see what each number looks like and practice identifying them in different ways. Let's get started!

**Lesson 1: What Does a Number Look Like?**

Numbers can be shown in many ways. They can be written as digits, which are the symbols that we use to represent numbers. They can also be shown using objects, like blocks or dots.

Here are the numbers 0 through 10 as digits:

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

Can you trace each number with your finger in the workbook? Great! Now, let's practice recognizing each number.

**Exercise 1: Match the Digit to the Picture**

Below are pictures with different numbers of objects. Draw a line from each set of objects to the correct number.

1. 🍎🍎 (Two apples)
2. 🚗 (One car)
3. 🐸🐸🐸 (Three frogs)
4. 🐟🐟🐟🐟 (Four fish)
5. 🍩🍩🍩🍩🍩 (Five donuts)

**Answers:**
1. 🍎🍎 to 2
2. 🚗 to 1
3. 🐸🐸🐸 to 3
4. 🐟🐟🐟🐟 to 4
5. 🍩🍩🍩🍩🍩 to 5

**Exercise 2: Recognizing Numbers in a Group**

Circle the number that you see in each group.

A. ( 7, 9, 8 ) Circle the number 8.

B. ( 1, 3, 2 ) Circle the number 1.

C. ( 4, 6, 5 ) Circle the number 6.

D. ( 10, 0, 9 ) Circle the number 0.

**Answers:**
A. 8 is circled.
B. 1 is circled.
C. 6 is circled.
D. 0 is circled.

**Lesson 2: Numbers All Around Us**

Numbers are everywhere! They can be found on clocks, calendars, and even on the pages of this workbook.

**Activity: Number Hunt**
Look around you right now. Can you spot any numbers from 0 to 10? Where did you find them? Write down or draw the numbers you find and where you saw them.

**Examples:**
- Number 2 on a clock
- Number 5 on a calendar
- Number 1 on the page number of this workbook

**Exercise 3: Number Writing Practice**

It's important to not only recognize numbers but also be able to write them. Trace the numbers below, and then try writing them on your own next to the traced numbers.

0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
