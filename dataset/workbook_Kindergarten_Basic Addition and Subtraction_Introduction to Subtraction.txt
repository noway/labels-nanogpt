# Basic Addition and Subtraction: Introduction to Subtraction

Welcome to the exciting world of subtraction, little learners! Subtraction is a fun part of math where we take away numbers from each other to find out how many are left. It's like having a bunch of yummy cookies and then sharing some with your friends. After you share, you see how many cookies you have left—that’s subtraction!

## What is Subtraction?

Subtraction is an operation just like addition, but instead of putting things together, we're taking them apart. When you subtract, you're finding the difference between two numbers. The number we start with is called the "minuend," the number we take away is called the "subtrahend," and the answer we get is called the "difference."

## Subtraction Sign

We use a special sign for subtraction, which looks like this: - (a minus sign).

For example: 
8 - 3 = 5 

In this subtraction problem, 8 is the minuend, 3 is the subtrahend, and 5 is the difference.

## Let's Try Some Subtraction!

To make this as fun as possible, we're going to practice by using things you can find around you, like your fingers, blocks, or drawings. It's easier to understand when we can see the numbers in action!

### Exercise 1: Subtract with Your Fingers

Start with all 10 fingers up. If I take away 2 fingers (put 2 fingers down), how many do I have left?

10 - 2 = 8

That's right! You should have 8 fingers standing. 

### Exercise 2: Subtract with Blocks

Imagine you have 5 blocks. If you give 3 blocks to your friend, how many blocks will you have?

5 - 3 = 2

You did it! You have 2 blocks left.

### Exercise 3: Drawing Pictures

Draw 6 smiley faces. Now, cross out 4 of them because they went to play outside. How many smiley faces are staying inside?

6 - 4 = 2

Great job! There are 2 smiley faces left.

## Subtraction Using Number Sentences

Now that you have practiced with your fingers, blocks, and drawings, let's learn how to write subtraction using number sentences. A number sentence is just like a story that tells about the numbers.

Here is an example:

7 candies - 2 candies eaten = 5 candies left

The number sentence for this would be: 

7 - 2 = 5

### Exercise 4: Create Number Sentences

Now, let's try creating some number sentences of our own. I'll give you the story, and you can write the number sentence.

1. You have 9 stickers, and you give away 4 stickers to your friend. How many stickers do you have now?

Answer: 9 - 4 = 5

2. There are 10 birds on a wire. 3 birds flew away. Write the number sentence to show how many birds are left on the wire.

Answer: 10 - 3 = 7

3. You have 4 books. You put 1 book back on the shelf. How many books are left with you?

Answer: 4 - 1 = 3

## Practice Makes Perfect

Subtraction is very useful and becomes easy with practice. You'll use subtraction in school, at home, and even when you play games! Remember that whenever you want to find out how many are left or what is remaining after taking some away, you'll be using subtraction.

Great work today, smart mathematicians! Keep practicing and soon you'll be able to subtract bigger numbers too. Have fun subtracting!
