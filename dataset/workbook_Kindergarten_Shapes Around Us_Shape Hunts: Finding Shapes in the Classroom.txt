# Chapter: Shapes Around Us

### Section: Shape Hunts - Finding Shapes in the Classroom

Welcome, little explorers! Today, we're going to become shape detectives. Our mission is to hunt for different shapes in our classroom. Each shape is unique, just like you! Grab your explorer hat, and let's start our Shape Hunt!

**Circle Hunt**

Circles are shapes with no corners or edges, and they are perfectly round. Let's see how many circles we can find in our classroom.

- **Clock:** Found it! The clock's face is a circle.
- **Doorknob:** There's another one! The doorknob is a circle too.
- **Coins:** Look in the teacher's purse or the classroom "Market." The coins are tiny, shiny circles.

**How many circles did you find?** 

Answers may vary, but here are possible findings:
- 1 clock
- 1 doorknob
- Several coins (students might count 5 to 10 coins or more)

Total number of circles found: 7 to 12 or more

**Square Hunt**

Squares have four equal sides and four corners. Let's see if we can find squares in our classroom.

- **Windowpanes:** If we look at the windows, each pane might be a square. Check them out!
- **Tiles on the Floor:** Some floors have tiles that are shaped like squares.
- **Alphabet blocks:** These often have square faces.

**How many squares did you find?**

Answers may vary, but here are possible findings:
- 4 windowpanes
- 20 floor tiles
- 6 alphabet blocks

Total number of squares found: 30

**Rectangle Hunt**

Rectangles are like stretched-out squares. They have four sides too, but two are longer than the other two.

- **Door:** The classroom door is a big rectangle.
- **Books:** Many of our books are rectangles. Let's count as many as we can find on the bookshelf.
- **Desks:** Our desks are also rectangles.

**How many rectangles did you find?**

Answers may vary, but here are possible findings:
- 1 door
- 15 books
- 5 desks

Total number of rectangles found: 21

**Triangle Hunt**

Triangles have three sides and three corners. They can be tricky to find, but I bet you can spot them.

- **Flag:** The classroom flag might have a triangle section.
- **Hanger:** A wire hanger can be bent into a triangle shape.
- **Musical instruments:** Some musical instruments like the triangle are shaped like their name!

**How many triangles did you find?**

Answers may vary, but here are possible findings:
- 1 triangle flag
- 1 wire hanger
- 1 triangle instrument

Total number of triangles found: 3
