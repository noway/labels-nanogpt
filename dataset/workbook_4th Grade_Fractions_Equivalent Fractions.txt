# Fractions Chapter - Equivalent Fractions Section

Welcome to the exciting world of Equivalent Fractions! In this section, we'll learn how different fractions can actually be the same, even if they look different. Remember that fractions are a way to represent parts of a whole. Let's dive straight into understanding equivalent fractions.

## What are Equivalent Fractions?

Equivalent fractions are fractions that may have different numerators and denominators but represent the same value. For example, 1/2 is the same as 2/4, even though the numbers are different. They are equivalent because they both represent the same part of a whole.

**Key Concept:**
- If you multiply or divide both the numerator and the denominator of a fraction by the same non-zero number, the fraction's value doesn't change.

## Let's Practice!

### Exercise 1: Identifying Equivalent Fractions

Look at each pair of fractions and determine if they are equivalent. Write Yes or No.

1. 1/2 and 2/4
2. 3/5 and 9/15
3. 4/7 and 8/14
4. 5/8 and 20/32
5. 6/10 and 3/5

**Answers:**

1. Yes
2. Yes
3. Yes
4. Yes
5. Yes

All the pairs listed are equivalent because if you simplify the fractions or find a common numerator or denominator, they represent the same value.

### Exercise 2: Creating Equivalent Fractions

Create an equivalent fraction by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the same number.

1. Multiply 1/3 by 2.
2. Multiply 2/5 by 3.
3. Multiply 4/7 by 4.
4. Multiply 3/6 by 5.
5. Multiply 5/9 by 6.

**Answers:**

1. 2/6
2. 6/15
3. 16/28
4. 15/30
5. 30/54

### Exercise 3: Simplifying to Find Equivalent Fractions

Simplify the following fractions to find an equivalent fraction with the smallest numerator and denominator possible.

1. Simplify 6/8.
2. Simplify 10/15.
3. Simplify 12/16.
4. Simplify 20/25.
5. Simplify 9/12.

**Answers:**

1. 3/4
2. 2/3
3. 3/4
4. 4/5
5. 3/4

### Exercise 4: Fill in the Missing Number

Find the number that makes the two fractions equivalent.

1. 5/? = 10/20
2. ?/9 = 6/27
3. 7/? = 28/32
4. ?/11 = 4/22
5. 3/? = 9/18

**Answers:**

1. 10 (Because 5 times 2 equals 10, and 10 times 2 equals 20)
2. 3 (Because 9 times 3 equals 27, and 6 divided by 2 equals 3)
3. 8 (Because 28 divided by 4 equals 7, and 32 divided by 4 equals 8)
4. 2 (Because 11 times 2 equals 22, and 4 divided by 2 equals 2)
5. 6 (Because 3 times 3 equals 9, and 6 times 3 equals 18)

Great job! You are now becoming a master of equivalent fractions. Keep practicing, and remember patience and practice make progress!
