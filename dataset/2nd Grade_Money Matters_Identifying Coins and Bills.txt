# Chapter: Money Matters

**Section: Identifying Coins and Bills**

Understanding money is a very important skill that we use in our everyday lives. There are coins and bills that we use to buy things like toys, snacks, and even save for bigger things we want in the future. In this section, we will learn how to identify the different types of coins and bills in the United States.

**Coins**

Coins are small, usually round pieces of metal that have different values. There are four main types of coins that we will learn about: the penny, the nickel, the dime, and the quarter.

1. **Penny** - A penny is worth 1 cent. It's the smallest value coin and it's made of copper, which gives it a reddish color. On one side of the penny, there is a picture of President Abraham Lincoln.

   **Exercise**: How many pennies do you need to make 5 cents? 
   
   **Answer**: You need 5 pennies to make 5 cents.
   
2. **Nickel** - The nickel is worth 5 cents. It is larger than the penny and is made of a nickel-copper blend. The nickel has an image of President Thomas Jefferson on one side.

   **Exercise**: If you have 2 nickels, how many cents do you have? 
   
   **Answer**: You have 10 cents because 2 nickels are worth 10 cents (2 x 5 = 10).

3. **Dime** - A dime is worth 10 cents. It is the smallest coin but worth more than the penny and the nickel. The dime has a portrait of President Franklin D. Roosevelt on one side.

   **Exercise**: How many dimes are needed to make 50 cents?

   **Answer**: You need 5 dimes to make 50 cents (5 x 10 = 50).

4. **Quarter** - The quarter is the largest of these coins and is worth 25 cents. The quarter has an image of President George Washington on one side.

   **Exercise**: If you have 2 quarters, how much money do you have? 
   
   **Answer**: You have 50 cents because 2 quarters are worth 50 cents (2 x 25 = 50).

**Bills**

Bills are paper money and come in different values: the one-dollar bill, the five-dollar bill, the ten-dollar bill, and the twenty-dollar bill. For now, we'll focus on these four.

1. **One-Dollar Bill** - The one-dollar bill is worth $1. It has a picture of President George Washington on the front.

   **Exercise**: How many one-dollar bills do you need to make $3?
   
   **Answer**: You need 3 one-dollar bills to make $3.

2. **Five-Dollar Bill** - The five-dollar bill is worth $5. It has a picture of President Abraham Lincoln on the front.

   **Exercise**: If you have 2 five-dollar bills, how much money do you have?
   
   **Answer**: You have $10 because 2 five-dollar bills are worth $10 (2 x 5 = 10).

3. **Ten-Dollar Bill** - The ten-dollar bill is worth $10. It has a picture of Alexander Hamilton, who was an important leader in American history, on the front.

   **Exercise**: How many ten-dollar bills do you need to buy a toy that costs $30?
   
   **Answer**: You need 3 ten-dollar bills to buy the toy (3 x 10 = 30).

4. **Twenty-Dollar Bill** - The twenty-dollar bill is worth $20. It has a picture of President Andrew Jackson on the front.

   **Exercise**: If you have 1 twenty-dollar bill, and you buy a book for $7, how much money will you get back?
   
   **Answer**: You will get back $13 because $20 - $7 = $13.

**Practice Exercises**

Let's practice what we've learned so far with some fun exercises!

1. **Matching**: Match the coin to its value.

   a) Penny
   b) Nickel
   c) Dime
   d) Quarter

   1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents

   **Answers**: 
   a - 1 cent
   b - 5 cents
   c - 10 cents
   d - 25 cents

2. **Counting Money**: Count the total value of the coins.

   a) 3 pennies, 1 nickel, 2 dimes, and 1 quarter
   b) 4 nickels and 5 dimes
   c) 10 pennies and 3 quarters

   **Answers**:
   a) Total = 3 + 5 + (2 x 10) + 25 = 3 + 5 + 20 + 25 = 53 cents
   b) Total = (4 x 5) + (5 x 10) = 20 + 50 = 70 cents
   c) Total = 10 + (3 x 25) = 10 + 75 = 85 cents

3. **Making Change**: You buy a sticker for $0.50 and pay with a one-dollar bill. How much change should you get back?

   **Answer**: $0.50 because $1.00 - $0.50 = $0.50

Remember, practice makes perfect! The more you work with coins and bills, the better you'll get at recognizing them and understanding their values. Keep practicing, little savers!
