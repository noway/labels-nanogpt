### Puzzle 1: Number Patterns

**Instructions:** Look at the number patterns below and fill in the missing numbers.

1. 2, 4, 6, _, 10, 12
2. 5, 10, 15, _, _, 30
3. 1, 2, _, 8, 16
4. 10, 8, 6, _, 2

**Completed Answers:**

1. 2, 4, 6, **8**, 10, 12
2. 5, 10, 15, **20**, **25**, 30
3. 1, 2, **4**, 8, 16
4. 10, 8, 6, **4**, 2

**Explanation:** For each sequence, look at how the numbers change from one to the next. In the first puzzle, we are adding 2 each time, so the missing number is 8. In the second puzzle, we add 5 to get to the next number. In the third puzzle, we are doubling the number to get the next one. In the last puzzle, we are subtracting 2 to get to the next number.

### Puzzle 2: Finding Shapes

**Instructions:** Count how many squares and triangles you can find in the picture below.

Here is the picture you would look at (imagine a grid with different shapes overlaid):

```
+---+---+---+
| / \ / \ / |
|/___\/___\/|
| \ / \ / \ |
|/__\/__\/__|
| / \ / \ / |
|/___\/___\/|
```

**Completed Answers:**

- Squares: **14**
- Triangles: **36**

**Explanation:** Each small square is counted as one square, and the larger 2x2 squares formed by combining four small squares are also counted. The triangles are counted by looking at each half of the squares, both the upside and the downside triangles.

### Puzzle 3: Addition and Subtraction Pyramid

**Instructions:** Complete the pyramid by starting from the top and finding the missing numbers that add up to the number below them.

```
   __7__
  /    \
 __?__ __?__
/    \/    \
  3      4  
/  \/  \
__?__ __?__
/    \/    \
  1      3  
```

**Completed Answers:**

```
   __7__
  /    \
 __4__ __3__
/    \/    \
  3      4  
/  \/  \
__1__ __2__
/    \/    \
  1      3  
```

**Explanation:** To solve this pyramid puzzle, we look at the bottom row of numbers first. To get the number directly above, we add the two numbers below it. So, to get the left '?' on the second row, we add 1 + 3 to get 4. To get the right '?' on the second row, we add 3 to the bottom right to get 3. The top of the pyramid is the sum of the second row, 4 + 3 equals 7, but we already have that number.

### Puzzle 4: Solve the Mystery Number

**Instructions:** Using the clues provided, figure out what the mystery number is!

1. The mystery number is more than 5 but less than 10.
2. It is an even number.
3. When you add 3 to the mystery number, you get 11.

**Completed Answer:**

- The Mystery Number: **8**

**Explanation:** The first clue tells us the number is between 5 and 10. The second clue tells us that it is even, so it could be 6 or 8 from the first clue. The third clue tells us that when we add 3, we get 11, so the mystery number is 8 because 8 + 3 = 11.
