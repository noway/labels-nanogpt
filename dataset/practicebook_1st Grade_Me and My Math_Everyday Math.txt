# Me and My Math

## Everyday Math

### Greetings, little mathematicians!

Every day, we use math in so many ways! Sometimes we don't even notice it. In this section, we'll explore how math can be part of our everyday lives. You'll practice counting, adding, subtracting, and even telling time! Let's get started with some fun activities that will help us see just how important and fun math can be.

### Activity 1: Counting Fun

Counting is everywhere! Let's start with some counting practice. Count the objects in each question and write the number in the blank space.

1. How many apples are in the basket?

   🍎🍎🍎🍎🍎

   Answer: _5 apples_

2. There are six balloons at the party. Draw one balloon for each count and then write how many you drew.

   🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈

   Answer: _6 balloons_

3. Count the wheels on the bicycles.

   🚲🚲

   Each bicycle has 2 wheels. So, 2 wheels + 2 wheels = 4 wheels.

   Answer: _4 wheels_

### Activity 2: Addition Station

Adding numbers helps us to know how many items we have in total. Let's solve some addition problems using items you know!

1. If you have 2 toy cars and you get 3 more, how many toy cars do you have now?
   
   2 cars + 3 cars = _5 cars_

2. There are 3 slices of pizza and you made 4 more slices. How many slices do you have?

   3 slices + 4 slices = _7 slices_

3. You found 4 seashells at the beach and your friend gives you 2 more. How many seashells do you have?

   4 seashells + 2 seashells = _6 seashells_

### Activity 3: Subtraction Station

Sometimes we need to take away some items from what we have. That's when we subtract!

1. You had 8 candies, but you ate 2. How many candies are left?

   8 candies - 2 candies = _6 candies_

2. There were 9 ducks in the pond, but 3 swam away. How many ducks are still in the pond?

   9 ducks - 3 ducks = _6 ducks_

3. You have 7 crayons, and you give 1 to your friend. How many crayons do you have now?

   7 crayons - 1 crayon = _6 crayons_

### Activity 4: What Time Is It?

Telling time can be a lot of fun. Let's look at the clocks and write down what time they show.

1. The clock shows 3:00. What are you usually doing at 3:00?

   Answer: _3:00 (It could be time for a nap or playtime!)_

2. The time is 7:00. Is it time to wake up, have lunch, or go to sleep?

   Answer: _7:00 (It could be time to wake up or even go to sleep if it's 7:00 PM.)_

3. It's 12:00 on the clock. What do you think you might be doing at 12:00?

   Answer: _12:00 (Lunchtime!)_
