# Introduction to Multiplication

### Welcome to the World of Multiplication!

Hello bright learners! Today, we are going to embark on a new math adventure. We will learn about multiplication, which is one of the four basic operations in mathematics. The other three are addition, subtraction, and division. Multiplication is a quick way of adding the same number several times. It’s like a super-hero version of addition!

Imagine you have 3 bags of apples, and each bag has 4 apples. You could count the apples one by one, but that might take a while. With multiplication, you can find the total number of apples quickly and easily!

### What is multiplication?

Multiplication is simply repeated addition. When we multiply, we are adding groups of the same size together. In math language, we would call the number of groups the "multiplier" and the size of each group the "multiplicand". The result of a multiplication is called the "product".

Let's say we have 5 groups of 2 stars:

⭐⭐
⭐⭐
⭐⭐
⭐⭐
⭐⭐

Instead of adding 2 stars + 2 stars + 2 stars + 2 stars + 2 stars, we can simply multiply 5 (the number of groups) by 2 (the number of stars in each group):
5 x 2 = 10 stars

### Symbols

In multiplication, we use the multiplication sign, which looks like a small "x" (×) or sometimes a small asterisk (*) or a dot (⋅).

### Let's Practice!

#### Exercise 1: Basic Multiplication

1. 3 × 2 = ?
2. 4 × 5 = ?
3. 1 × 7 = ?
4. 6 × 3 = ?
5. 0 × 9 = ?

#### Answers to Exercise 1:

1. 3 × 2 = 6 (3 groups of 2 is 6)
2. 4 × 5 = 20 (4 groups of 5 is 20)
3. 1 × 7 = 7 (1 group of 7 is 7)
4. 6 × 3 = 18 (6 groups of 3 is 18)
5. 0 × 9 = 0 (0 groups of anything is always 0)

#### Exercise 2: Real-life Multiplication

1. You have 4 plates with 5 cookies on each plate. How many cookies do you have in total?
2. There are 7 rows of trees, and each row has 4 trees. How many trees are there altogether?
3. A book has 8 pages, and there are 3 pictures on each page. How many pictures are in the book?

#### Answers to Exercise 2:

1. 4 plates × 5 cookies = 20 cookies
2. 7 rows × 4 trees = 28 trees
3. 8 pages × 3 pictures = 24 pictures

### Multiplication with Arrays

Another way to visualize multiplication is using arrays. An array is a set of objects organized into rows and columns that form a rectangle. Each row has the same number of objects, just like in multiplication!

For example, 3 rows of 4 stars can be shown as:

⭐⭐⭐⭐
⭐⭐⭐⭐
⭐⭐⭐⭐

This array is showing 3 × 4 = 12 stars.

### Practice with Arrays

#### Exercise 3: Drawing Arrays

Draw an array for each of the following multiplication problems:

1. 2 × 3
2. 5 × 2
3. 4 × 4

### Conclusion

Well done! You are now beginning to understand how multiplication works. Remember, multiplication is a faster way to add groups of the same number. Keep practicing and always look for patterns. Multiplication is everywhere! Be sure to complete the exercises and check your answers with the provided solutions. You’re becoming a multiplication star already! Keep up the good work!

Remember, practice makes perfect. The more you multiply, the better you'll get. Happy multiplying, third graders!
