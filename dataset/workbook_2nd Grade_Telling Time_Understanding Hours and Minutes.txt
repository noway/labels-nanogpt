# "Understanding Hours and Minutes" 

## What Are Hours and Minutes?

Time is a way to measure how long something takes or how long between one event and another. In our daily lives, we use hours and minutes to do this. 

### Hours:
An hour is a longer unit of time. When you are at school, you might have an hour-long class, or you might sleep for about 8 hours each night. There are 24 hours in a day. The day is split into two parts: from midnight to noon (12:00 AM to 11:59 AM) is called "AM," and from noon to midnight (12:00 PM to 11:59 PM) is known as "PM."

### Minutes:
A minute is a shorter unit of time. There are 60 minutes in an hour. If you are counting how long you play a game or wait for lunch, you might measure that time in minutes.

## How to Read a Clock

A clock has numbers from 1 to 12, a short hand (the hour hand), and a longer hand (the minute hand). Sometimes there is also a very thin hand that moves quickly called the second hand, but we will focus on hours and minutes for now.

When the long hand points to 12, we say it is something o'clock. This is when a new hour starts!

### Exercise 1: What Time Is It?

Look at the clock drawings below and write down the time.

1. The short hand is on the 3, and the long hand is on the 12.
2. The short hand is just past the 9, and the long hand is on the 6.
3. The short hand is between the 6 and the 7, and the long hand is on the 3.

#### Answers:

1. 3:00 (3 o'clock)
2. 9:30 (half past nine)
3. 6:15 (quarter past six)

### Exercise 2: Hours and Minutes

Fill in the blanks with the correct time.

1. It is _____ hours and _____ minutes when the short hand is on the 10 and the long hand is on the 6.
2. It is _____ hours and _____ minutes when the short hand is pointing between the 2 and the 3, and the long hand is on the 9.

#### Answers:

1. It is 10 hours and 30 minutes (10:30 or half past ten).
2. It is 2 hours and 45 minutes (2:45 or quarter to three).

### Exercise 3: Drawing the Time

Draw the hands on the clock to show these times:

1. 7:00 (7 o'clock)
2. 5:15 (quarter after five)
3. 8:45 (quarter to nine)

#### Answers:

1. Draw the short hand on the 7 and the long hand on the 12.
2. Draw the short hand slightly past the 5 and the long hand on the 3.
3. Draw the short hand between the 8 and the 9 and the long hand on the 9.

## Remember:

- The short hand shows the hour and moves slowly.
- The long hand shows the minutes and moves faster – it goes all the way around the clock every hour.
- Every time the long hand goes around from 12 back to 12, the hour hand moves to the next number.
- When the long hand points to 12, we are at the start of an hour.
- When the long hand points to 6, it is half past the hour.
- When the long hand points to 3, it is a quarter past the hour.
- When the long hand points to 9, it is a quarter to the next hour.

Practice makes perfect! Keep working on these exercises, and you’ll be telling time like a pro in no time!
