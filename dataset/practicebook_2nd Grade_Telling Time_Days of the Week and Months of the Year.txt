# Telling Time: Days of the Week and Months of the Year

Welcome to the "Days of the Week and Months of the Year" section of your math practice book. Understanding the days of the week and the months of the year is an important part of telling time. Let's learn and practice together!

### Days of the Week

There are seven days in a week. The days of the week in order are:

1. Sunday
2. Monday
3. Tuesday
4. Wednesday
5. Thursday
6. Friday
7. Saturday

**Exercise 1:** Circle the first day of the week.

*Answer:* Sunday is circled.

**Exercise 2:** What day comes after Tuesday?

*Answer:* Wednesday.

**Exercise 3:** Fill in the missing days: 
- Monday, ____, Wednesday, ____, Friday.

*Answer:* Tuesday, Thursday.

**Exercise 4:** Put a checkmark next to the last day of the week.

*Answer:* A checkmark is next to Saturday.

### Months of the Year

There are twelve months in a year. Here is the list of months in order:

1. January
2. February
3. March
4. April
5. May
6. June
7. July
8. August
9. September
10. October

**Exercise 9:** Put these months in order: July, March, December, October.

*Answer:* March, July, October, December.

### Mixing Days and Months

Sometimes, we talk about days and months together, for example, when we say, "My birthday is on Thursday, April 20th." 

**Exercise 10:** If your birthday is on Saturday this year and your birthday is on January 15th, what day of the week will your birthday be next year?

*Hint:* Most years, the same date moves forward one day of the week (for example, from Saturday to Sunday), but if this year is a leap year (and January 15th has passed), then it will move forward two days (from Saturday to Monday).

*Answer:* If this year is not a leap year, my birthday will be on Sunday next year. If this year is a leap year, then it will be on Monday.

### Seasons and Months

In many places around the world, the year is divided into four seasons:

- Spring: March, April, May
- Summer: June, July, August
- Autumn (or Fall): September, October, November
- Winter: December, January, February

**Exercise 11:** Which season has the month of April in it?

*Answer:* Spring.

**Exercise 12:** List the seasons and write down one month that belongs to each season.

*Answer:*
- Spring: March
- Summer: July
- Autumn (Fall): October
- Winter: January
