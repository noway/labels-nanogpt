# Introduction to Addition

Welcome to the world of numbers, little learners! Today, we are going to embark on a fantastic journey to discover the magic of addition. Addition is like putting things together to find out how many items you have in total. It’s a building block of math that you will use all the time, from counting apples to calculating scores in a game.

## What Is Addition?

Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers to make a new, bigger number. When we add, we are finding out how many we have in all.

Imagine you have 2 red balloons and 3 blue balloons. If you want to know how many balloons you have altogether, you add the red balloons to the blue balloons. This is addition!

In math, we use a special sign called the "plus" sign to show addition. It looks like this: +

We also use an "equals" sign to show the result. It looks like this: =

So if you add 2 red balloons and 3 blue balloons, you would write it like this:

2 + 3 = 5

That means, 2 balloons plus 3 balloons equals 5 balloons altogether!

## Let's Practice Adding!

Let's start with some easy examples. Remember, when we add, we are putting numbers together!

### Example 1:

**Problem:** What is 1 + 1?

**Solution:** If you have 1 toy car and you get 1 more, now you have 1 car plus 1 more car which makes 2 cars.

So, 1 + 1 = 2

### Example 2:

**Problem:** What is 2 + 3?

**Solution:** If you have 2 cookies and your friend gives you 3 more cookies, you can count them all together: 1, 2, and then 3 more makes 3, 4, 5.

So, 2 + 3 = 5

### Example 3:

**Problem:** What is 4 + 2?

**Solution:** If you have 4 stickers and your teacher gives you 2 more stickers, you can count all your stickers starting with the 4 you already have: 4, 5, 6.

So, 4 + 2 = 6

## Exercises for You!

Now, it's your turn to try some addition problems! After you write down your answer, you can check it with the answer provided.

1. 1 + 2 = ?
2. 3 + 1 = ?
3. 0 + 4 = ?
4. 5 + 0 = ?
5. 2 + 2 = ?

## Answers to the Exercises:

1. 1 + 2 = 3 (Great job! You have 3 in total!)
2. 3 + 1 = 4 (Awesome! 3 plus 1 more makes 4!)
3. 0 + 4 = 4 (Good work! If you start with none and add 4, you have 4!)
4. 5 + 0 = 5 (Super! If you have 5 and add none, you still have 5!)
5. 2 + 2 = 4 (Fantastic! 2 and 2 more make 4!)

Great work, everyone! You're now on your way to becoming addition experts. Remember, practice makes perfect so keep counting and adding. Addition is fun and helps us solve so many everyday problems. Keep practicing, and you’ll be adding bigger numbers in no time at all!
