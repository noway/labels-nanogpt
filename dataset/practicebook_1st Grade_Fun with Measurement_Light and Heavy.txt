## Exploring Light and Heavy

**What does it mean?**

* **Light**: An object is considered light if it does not weigh much. You can easily lift or move it without much effort.
* **Heavy**: An object is heavy when it weighs a lot. You may have a hard time trying to lift or move it.

**Let's Practice Comparing!**

1. Look at the pictures below and circle the object that is lighter.

    a. A feather **(circled)** or a rock.
    b. A beach ball **(circled)** or a basketball.
    c. An apple or a watermelon **(circled)**.
    d. A leaf **(circled)** or a brick.

    **Answers:** 
    a. Feather
    b. Beach ball
    c. Apple
    d. Leaf

2. Now, circle the object that is heavier.

    a. A pencil **(circled)** or a paper clip.
    b. A puppy **(circled)** or a kitten.
    c. A slice of bread **(circled)** or a crumb.
    d. A gallon of milk **(circled)** or a carton of eggs.

    **Answers:**
    a. Pencil
    b. Puppy

    Cotton ball | Hammer
    Balloon | Bucket of water
    Sponge | Dictionary

    **Answers:**
    
    Light objects: Cotton ball, Balloon, Sponge

## Classifying with Scales

1. Imagine you have a balance scale. Which side will go down? Draw an arrow pointing down to the heavier side.

    a. A bunch of bananas <==> A loaf of bread
    b. A basket of apples <==> A single apple
    c. A packet of feathers <==> A packet of pebbles

    **Arrows Pointing:**

    a. Bananas ↓ | Bread ↑
    b. Basket of apples ↓ | Apple ↑
    c. Feathers ↑ | Pebbles ↓

    **Answers:**
    
    a. The bunch of bananas is heavier.
    b. The basket of apples is heavier.
    c. The packet of pebbles is heavier.

## Review Questions

1. What do you find easy to carry in your backpack and why?

   **Answer:** Light items like a notebook or a pencil are easy to carry in a backpack because they do not weigh much.

   **Answer:** A soccer ball, a scarf, and a water bottle are all lighter than a bicycle.

3. If you have a toy car and a real car, which one is heavier and why?

   **Answer:** The real car is heavier because it is much bigger and made of metal and other materials that add a lot of weight.

## Reflection

Great job on learning about light and heavy objects! Remember, determining if something is light or heavy can depend on its size, material, and how much matter is inside it. Keep practicing, and soon you’ll be a measurement master!

Always look for opportunities to compare the weight of different objects around you. Can you tell which is lighter or heavier without lifting them? With practice, you'll get better at making these judgments!

Remember to have an adult help you if you're not sure about the weight of something, especially if it could be too heavy for you to lift safely. Safety first! Now, go and explore more light and heavy objects around you and have fun comparing them!
