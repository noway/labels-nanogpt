# Chapter: Fun with Math
## Section: Storytime with Math

Welcome to "Storytime with Math," little learners! Are you ready to dive into fun stories that will help you explore the wonderful world of numbers? Let's embark on an adventure with our friends — Sammy the Squirrel, Ellie the Elephant, and Max the Monkey — as they discover counting, shapes, and sizes through exciting stories. At the end of each story, you’ll find some exercises with answers to practice what Sammy, Ellie, and Max have learned. Let's begin!

### Story 1: Sammy the Squirrel's Nutty Counting

Once upon a time, in a lush green forest, there was a cheerful squirrel named Sammy. Sammy loved nuts more than anything! One sunny morning, Sammy decided to count all the acorns he had gathered for the winter.

He started laying them out in a line:
1 acorn, 2 acorns, 3 acorns, and so on.

When he reached 10, he noticed that he could count his acorns by 2s to make it faster! With his tiny fingers, he paired them: 
2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

**Exercise 1:**
Count with Sammy. How many acorns does Sammy have if he continues counting by 2s up to 20?

Answers: 
12, 14, 16, 18, 20. Sammy now has 10 pairs of acorns, which equals 20 acorns!

### Story 2: Ellie the Elephant’s Big Shapes Parade

Ellie the Elephant loves shapes. One day, she decided to organize a parade where each of her friends would bring a shape. Ducks brought circles like their pond, the mice brought tiny squares like their cheese, and zebras brought triangles like the pyramids they had seen in books.

As each friend marched by, Ellie saw that the ducks had 3 circles, the mice had 4 squares, and the zebras had 5 triangles.

**Exercise 2:**
Can you count all the shapes in Ellie’s parade?

Answers:
3 circles + 4 squares + 5 triangles = 12 shapes!

### Story 3: Max the Monkey's Size Surprise

Max the Monkey loved to jump from tree to tree. He noticed that some trees were tall, some were medium-sized, and others were small. To make his game more fun, he would only jump to a tree that was taller than the last one he was on.

One day, he started on a small tree, then jumped to a medium one, and finally leaped to a tall tree, where he found a juicy mango.

**Exercise 3:**
Can you help Max find another path from a small tree to the tallest tree by choosing trees that are taller than the last one?

Answers:
Possible paths can vary, but here is one: 
- Start at a small tree.
- Then, leap to another tree that is a little taller than the first one.
- Finally, jump to the tallest tree where Max can enjoy a delicious mango.

### Story 4: Bonus Numbers Adventure 

Sammy, Ellie, and Max were playing hide and seek in the forest. Sammy hid behind 1 bush, Ellie hid behind another bigger bush, and Max climbed up to hide behind 1 leaf at the top of the biggest tree.

**Exercise 4:**
Could you help find out how many friends are hiding if you add up all the hiding spots?

Answers:
Each friend is hiding at 1 spot: 
1 (Sammy) + 1 (Ellie) + 1 (Max) = 3 friends are hiding!
