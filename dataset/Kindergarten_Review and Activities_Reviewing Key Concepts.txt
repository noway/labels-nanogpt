# Review of Key Concepts

Welcome back, young mathematicians! Now that we've had lots of fun exploring numbers and shapes, let's take a moment to review the key concepts we have learned in our math adventure. Remember, practice makes perfect, so let's go over some of the important ideas and try some practice exercises to show what you've learned!

## 1. Counting and Numbers
**Key Concepts:**
- We've learned how to count from 1 to 10, and recognize numbers in written form.
- We understand that numbers represent quantities and can be used to tell us "how many" of something we have.

**Example Exercise:**
- Can you count the apples in the basket?
    
    🍎 🍏 🍎 🍎 🍏
    
**Answer:**
- There are 5 apples in the basket.

## 2. Shapes and Sizes
**Key Concepts:**
- We have explored basic shapes like circles, squares, triangles, and rectangles.
- We can recognize these shapes in different orientations and sizes.

**Example Exercise:**
- Look around your room and find an object that is shaped like a circle. What did you find?

**Answer:**
- A clock on the wall. (Answers may vary)

## 3. Comparing Quantities
**Key Concepts:**
- We've learned to compare sets of objects using words like "more," "less," and "equal."
- We can see which group has more or less, or if they have the same amount.

**Example Exercise:**
- Which pile has more balls?

    Pile 1: ⚽ ⚾ 🏀
    
    Pile 2: ⚽

**Answer:**
- Pile 1 has more balls.

## 4. Number Sequences
**Key Concepts:**
- We can arrange numbers in order from smallest to largest.
- We also practiced counting in sequences and can identify what number comes next.

**Example Exercise:**
- What number comes next? 1, 2, 3, 4, ___

**Answer:**
- The next number is 5.

## 5. Addition Basics
**Key Concepts:**
- We've begun to understand addition as putting two groups of objects together to find out "how many in all."

**Example Exercise:**
- If you have 2 red balloons and 3 blue balloons, how many balloons do you have in all?

    🎈🎈 + 🎈🎈🎈

**Answer:**
- You have 5 balloons in all.

## 6. Subtraction Basics
**Key Concepts:**
- We learned that subtraction means taking away from a group of objects.
- We can find out "how many are left" by subtracting.

**Example Exercise:**
- There are 4 cookies, and you eat 1. How many cookies are left?

    🍪🍪🍪🍪 - 🍪

**Answer:**
- There are 3 cookies left.

Remember to check with your grown-up helper if you are unsure about any of these exercises or need a little bit of help. Now, let's move forward to the activities section, where you can practice these concepts some more. Keep up the great work!
