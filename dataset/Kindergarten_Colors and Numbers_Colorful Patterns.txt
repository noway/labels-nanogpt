# Chapter: Colors and Numbers

## Section 2.3: Colorful Patterns

Patterns can be found everywhere – in the clothes we wear, the buildings we see, and even in the foods we eat! A pattern is a design that repeats itself in a predictable way. In this section, we will explore patterns using beautiful colors.

### What is a Pattern?

A pattern is a sequence that repeats itself. Sometimes a pattern repeats colors, shapes, numbers, or even objects. Today we will focus on color patterns.

### Creating Color Patterns

Look around you for colorful objects like blocks, crayons, or stickers. We can use these to make color patterns.

Here’s how:

1. Choose a few different colors to start with, like red, yellow, and blue.
2. Arrange the colors in a certain order, such as red, yellow, blue.
3. Repeat this order to create a pattern: red, yellow, blue, red, yellow, blue.

**Example Pattern 1:**

- Original: red, yellow, blue
- Pattern: red, yellow, blue, red, yellow, blue

Now let's do that with shapes and colors! For example, blue circles and red squares.

**Example Pattern 2:**

- Original: blue circle, red square, blue circle
- Pattern: blue circle, red square, blue circle, blue circle, red square, blue circle

**Note:** The second pattern has blue circle repeated because every color has a shape with it, and we repeat the color-shape pair. 

Now, try it yourself using the colors and shapes you want!

### Exercise 1: Creating Your Own Color Pattern

### Let’s Review

Patterns have a sequence that repeats. You can make patterns with colors, shapes, or both. Finding patterns helps us predict what comes next and is a fun way to learn about the world.

Excellent work with your patterns! Remember, a pattern can be anything that repeats itself in the same way, so be sure to look for patterns everywhere you go!

For further practice, try making color patterns with items you find at home or outside. Can you make a pattern with leaves or rocks?

Now, let's move on and see what we can learn next about colors and numbers!
