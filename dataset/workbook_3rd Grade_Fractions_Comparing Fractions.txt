## Understanding Fractions

Before we start comparing fractions, let's make sure we understand what fractions are. A fraction represents a part of a whole. It has a numerator (the top number) and a denominator (the bottom number). The numerator tells us how many parts we have, and the denominator tells us into how many equal parts the whole is divided.

## Comparing Fractions

Comparing fractions means deciding which of two fractions is larger or if they are equal. There are a few different methods to compare fractions: by finding common denominators, comparing to a benchmark fraction (like 1/2), or by cross-multiplying.

### Method 1: Common Denominators

To compare fractions with different denominators, you can find a common denominator. This means converting the fractions so that their denominators are the same. Then, you simply compare the numerators.

### Practice Problems:

1. Compare 1/4 and 1/3 by finding a common denominator.

   Solution: The common denominator for 1/4 and 1/3 is 12. We convert 1/4 to 3/12 and 1/3 to 4/12. Since 3/12 < 4/12, 1/4 is less than 1/3.

2. Which is greater: 3/8 or 2/5?

   Solution: The common denominator for 3/8 and 2/5 is 40. We convert 3/8 to 15/40 and 2/5 to 16/40. Since 15/40 < 16/40, 3/8 is less than 2/5.

### Method 2: Benchmark Fractions

You can also compare fractions by using a benchmark fraction such as 1/2. If one fraction is above the benchmark and the other is below, you know which is larger.

### Practice Problems:

1. Which is larger: 5/9 or 2/4?

   Solution: 2/4 is equal to the benchmark 1/2, while 5/9 is more than half (since 4.5/9 would be half). Therefore, 5/9 is larger than 2/4.

2. Decide if 3/7 is greater than, less than, or equal to 1/2.

   Solution: 3.5/7 would be equal to 1/2, so 3/7 is less than 1/2.

### Method 3: Cross-Multiplying

When comparing two fractions, you can cross-multiply. If the product of the cross-multiplication on one side is larger than the other, then that fraction is larger.

### Practice Problems:

1. Compare 2/3 and 3/5 using cross-multiplication.

   Solution: 2/3 ? 3/5. Cross-multiplying gives us 2 × 5 and 3 × 3, which are 10 and 9 respectively. Since 10 > 9, 2/3 is greater than 3/5.

2. Which is greater: 4/7 or 5/8?

   Solution: 4/7 ? 5/8. Cross-multiplying gives us 4 × 8 and 7 × 5, which are 32 and 35 respectively. Since 32 < 35, 4/7 is less than 5/8.
