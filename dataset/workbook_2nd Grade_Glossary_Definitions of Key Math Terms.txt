# Definitions of Key Math Terms

### Addition
Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers to find their total amount. The symbol for addition is +. For example, 3 + 2 = 5.

### Sum
The sum is the answer you get when you add two or more numbers together. For example, when we add 4 + 3, the sum is 7.

### Subtraction
Subtraction is the process of taking one number away from another to find out how much more one is than the other. The symbol for subtraction is -. For example, 5 - 2 = 3.

### Difference
The difference is the answer you get when you subtract one number from another. For example, if we subtract 6 from 9, the difference is 3.

### Multiplication
Multiplication is a way of adding the same number several times. The symbol for multiplication is × or a dot (•). For instance, 4 × 2 means add 4 two times, which equals 8.

### Product
The product is the answer to a multiplication problem. When we multiply 3 times 5, the product is 15.

### Division
Division is the process of splitting a number into equal parts. The symbol for division is ÷ or a slash (/). For example, 8 ÷ 2 means dividing 8 into 2 equal parts, which equals 4.

### Quotient
The quotient is the answer to a division problem. If 20 is divided by 5, the quotient is 4.

### Remainder
A remainder is the amount left over in a division problem when the numbers do not divide evenly. For example, when 10 is divided by 3, the quotient is 3, and the remainder is 1.

### Equal
Equal means the same in value or amount. The symbol for equal is =. If 2 + 3 = 5, then 2 + 3 is equal to 5.

### Even Number
An even number is a whole number that can be divided by 2 without a remainder. Examples include 2, 4, 6, and 8.

### Odd Number
An odd number is a whole number that cannot be divided by 2 without a remainder. Examples include 1, 3, 5, and 7.

### Place Value
Place value is the value of where a digit is in a number. In the number 123, the 2 is in the "tens" place, which means it actually represents 20.

### Digit
A digit is any one of the numerical symbols 0 through 9 that we use to write numbers.

### Number Line
A number line is a straight line with numbers placed at even intervals along the length. It can be used to represent numbers and their relationships to each other.

### Greater Than
The symbol ">" means greater than and is used to compare two numbers, where the first number is larger than the second. For example, 8 > 5.

### Less Than
The symbol "<" means less than and is used to compare two numbers, where the first number is smaller than the second. For example, 3 < 6.

### Fraction
A fraction represents a part of a whole or a division of a quantity into equal parts. It has a top number (numerator) and a bottom number (denominator), like 1/2 or 3/4.

### Numerator
The numerator is the top number of a fraction that tells how many parts of the whole or group are being considered.

### Denominator
The denominator is the bottom number of a fraction that shows the total number of equal parts the whole is divided into.

### Geometry
Geometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the sizes, shapes, positions, and dimensions of things. It involves understanding and using different shapes and the relationships between them.

### Shape
A shape is the form of an object, such as a square, triangle, or circle, each of which has specific properties.

### Pattern
A pattern is a repeated decorative design or a sequence that shows some form of regularity. In math, patterns are often series of numbers that follow a rule.

### Measurement
Measurement is the process of determining the size, length, or amount of something. In math, common measurements include length, weight, and volume.

### Data
Data are pieces of information collected by observation or research that can be used for analysis or calculation.

### Graph
A graph is a visual representation of data that shows the relationships between different sets of information.
