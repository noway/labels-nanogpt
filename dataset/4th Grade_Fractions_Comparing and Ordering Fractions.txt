## Comparing and Ordering Fractions

### Understanding Fractions

Before we start comparing and ordering fractions, remember that a fraction represents a part of a whole. It consists of a numerator (the top number), which tells us how many parts we have, and a denominator (the bottom number), which tells us how many equal parts the whole is divided into.

### Comparing Fractions

Comparing fractions means determining which fraction is greater or if the fractions are equal. Here are some steps and methods you can use to compare fractions:

#### Method 1: Same Denominator

When fractions have the same denominator, we can compare them by looking at their numerators. The larger the numerator, the larger the fraction.

**Example:**
- Compare 3/8 and 5/8.
- Since the denominators are the same (8), we look at the numerators.
- 5 is greater than 3, so 5/8 is greater than 3/8.

#### Method 2: Same Numerator

When fractions have the same numerator, the fraction with the smaller denominator is greater because it means each part is larger.

**Example:**
- Compare 4/5 and 4/9.
- Since the numerators are the same (4), we look at the denominators.
- 5 is less than 9, so 4/5 is greater than 4/9.

#### Method 3: Different Numerators and Denominators

When fractions have different numerators and denominators, you can either find a common denominator or convert the fractions to decimals.

##### Finding a Common Denominator:

1. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators.
2. Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCM as the new denominator.
3. Compare the new numerators.

**Example:**
- Compare 2/3 and 3/4.
- The LCM of 3 and 4 is 12.
- Convert 2/3 to 8/12 (because 2 × 4 = 8) and 3/4 to 9/12 (because 3 × 3 = 9).
- Compare 8/12 and 9/12. Since 9 is greater than 8, 3/4 is greater than 2/3.

##### Converting to Decimals:

1. Divide the numerator by the denominator to convert each fraction to a decimal.
2. Compare the decimal values.

**Example:**
- Compare 1/2 and 2/5.
- Convert 1/2 to 0.5 (because 1 ÷ 2 = 0.5) and 2/5 to 0.4 (because 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4).
- Since 0.5 is greater than 0.4, 1/2 is greater than 2/5.

### Ordering Fractions

Ordering fractions means arranging them from least to greatest or greatest to least. Use the comparing methods from above to help you order a set of fractions.

**Example:**
- Order the fractions 3/4, 2/3, and 5/8 from least to greatest.
- Find the LCM of the denominators 4, 3, and 8, which is 24.
- Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the new denominator:
  - 3/4 = 18/24
  - 2/3 = 16/24
  - 5/8 = 15/24
- Now, order them by their new numerators: 15/24, 16/24, and 18/24.
- So, 5/8 is least, then 2/3, and 3/4 is the greatest.

### Practice Exercises

Now, let's practice comparing and ordering fractions.

**Exercise 1:**
Compare the following pairs of fractions without finding a common denominator.
a) 5/7 and 4/7
b) 6/10 and 6/15

**Exercise 2:**
Compare the following fractions by finding a common denominator.
a) 7/8 and 5/6
b) 1/3 and 2/7

**Exercise 3:**
Order the following sets of fractions from least to greatest.
a) 2/5, 1/2, 3/4
b) 5/6, 1/3, 2/3

### Answers

**Exercise 1:**
a) 5/7 is greater than 4/7 because they share the same denominator.
b) 6/10 is greater than 6/15 because they share the same numerator, and 10 is less than 15.

**Exercise 2:**
a) 7/8 and 5/6 have a common denominator of 24. Convert to 21/24 and 20/24. Therefore, 7/8 is greater than 5/6.
b) 1/3 and 2/7 have a common denominator of 21. Convert to 7/21 and 6/21. Therefore, 1/3 is greater than 2/7.

**Exercise 3:**
a) Convert to common denominators: 2/5 = 10/25, 1/2 = 12/25, 3/4 = 18/25. Order: 2/5, 1/2, 3/4.
b) Convert to common denominators: 5/6 = 15/18, 1/3 = 6/18, 2/3 = 12/18. Order: 1/3, 2/3, 5/6.

Always remember, when comparing or ordering fractions, first look to see if they have the same numerators or denominators; if not, find common ground by either finding a common denominator or converting to decimals. Keep practicing, and soon you'll be a fraction comparing and ordering pro!
