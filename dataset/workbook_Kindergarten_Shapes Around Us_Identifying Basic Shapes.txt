# Shapes Around Us: Identifying Basic Shapes

Welcome to the wonderful world of shapes! In this section, we are going to learn about some of the basic shapes that we see around us every day. Each shape has its own name and characteristics. Understanding these shapes will help you notice all the amazing forms that make up our world. Let's begin!

## Circle

A circle is a round shape with no corners or edges. It is perfectly smooth and the edge is an equal distance from the center, all the way around. Can you spot a circle in your classroom or home? Maybe you see it in the shape of a clock or a coin.

**Exercise:** Draw a circle in the space below and find 1 object in the classroom that is a circle.

**Your Answer:** (A drawn circle)  
**Example of a circle-shaped object:** Clock.

## Square

A square has four equal sides and four corners. Each corner is called an "angle" and in a square, each of these angles is a right angle, which means they each measure 90 degrees.

**Exercise:** Draw a square and find 1 object in the classroom that is a square.

**Your Answer:** (A drawn square)  
**Example of a square-shaped object:** Picture frame.

## Rectangle

Rectangles are like extended squares. They have four sides and four angles as well, but unlike squares, the sides are not all equal. Two sides are longer and two sides are shorter. However, all the angles in a rectangle are still right angles.

**Exercise:** Draw a rectangle and find 1 object in the room that is a rectangle.

**Your Answer:** (A drawn rectangle)  
**Example of a rectangle-shaped object:** Door.

## Triangle

A triangle has three sides and three corners, which are also angles. Triangles can have sides that are all the same length or sides of different lengths. The angles can vary, but the angles in any triangle always add up to 180 degrees.

**Exercise:** Draw a triangle and find 1 object in the classroom that has a triangular shape.

**Your Answer:** (A drawn triangle)  
**Example of a triangular-shaped object:** Slice of pizza.

## Oval

An oval is like an elongated circle. It is also round and has no corners, but it is not perfectly round like a circle. It is stretched out in one direction.

**Exercise:** Draw an oval and find 1 object in the room that is an oval.

**Your Answer:** (A drawn oval)  
**Example of an oval-shaped object:** Rug.

## Diamond (Rhombus)

A diamond, or rhombus, is a shape with four sides of equal length and opposite sides are parallel. It looks like a square that is tilted on one of its corners.

**Exercise:** Draw a diamond and find 1 object that is diamond-shaped.

**Your Answer:** (A drawn diamond)  
**Example of a diamond-shaped object:** Kite.
