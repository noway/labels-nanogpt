# Fun with Measurement: Long and Short

Hello young mathematician! Today we are going to have some fun with measurement. Measurement helps us find out how long or short things are. Let’s explore what that means with some activities you can do.

**Exercise 1: Understanding Long and Short**

Draw a line next to each object to show how long it is. Then, circle the object that is longer.

1. A pencil and a crayon.
2. A shoe and a sock.
3. A school bus and a bicycle.

*Answers:*
1. The pencil is circled.
2. The shoe is circled.
3. The school bus is circled.

**Exercise 2: Comparing Lengths**

Look at the pairs of items below. Write "longer" or "shorter" to compare the second item to the first.

1. A piece of spaghetti _______ (vs. a noodle)
2. A lizard _______ (vs. a crocodile)
3. A worm _______ (vs. a snail)

*Answers:*
1. shorter
2. shorter
3. longer

**Exercise 3: Measuring with Objects**

Use paper clips to measure the length of the items below. Write how many paper clips long each item is.

1. Your math book.
2. A pair of scissors.
3. Your foot.

**Exercise 4: Finding Long and Short at Home**

Find three objects at home that you think are long and three objects that you think are short. Write their names and draw a picture of each.

**Exercise 5: Sorting by Length**

Below are pictures of different objects. Cut them out and glue them in order from shortest to longest.

*Images would be provided in a printed book for the student to cut and sort. Include a variety of objects of differing lengths, such as a toothbrush, a baseball bat, a ladder, a pen, and a skateboard.*

*Answers:*
Order from shortest to longest: toothbrush, pen, skateboard, baseball bat, ladder.

**Exercise 6: The Longest and The Shortest**

Out of all the items you've worked with today, which one do you think is the longest? Which one is the shortest? Circle your answer in each question.

Remember that "long" and "short" are words we use to describe length. When we say something is long, it means it has a greater length, and when something is short, it has a smaller length. You did great today exploring long and short objects! Keep practicing and you’ll be a measurement expert in no time!

Remember to always use the same size object (like the paper clip) when you measure, so that your measurements are fair and you can compare them. Have fun measuring more objects around you!
