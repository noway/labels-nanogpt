## Shape Patterns

Welcome to the exciting world of Shape Patterns! Patterns are everywhere around us, and they are especially fun to create and find. In this section, we will learn all about different kinds of shapes and how they can form patterns. But first, let’s remember some of the basic shapes we see every day:

- **Circle** - A round shape with no corners, like a cookie or a coin.
- **Square** - A shape with four equal sides and four corners, like a checkerboard piece.
- **Rectangle** - A shape with four sides where opposite sides are equal, like a book or a door.
- **Triangle** - A shape with three sides and three corners, like a slice of pizza or a pyramid.

### What is a Pattern?
A pattern is a repeating sequence that follows a certain rule we can figure out. When we talk about shape patterns, we mean a sequence of shapes that repeat in a specific, recognizable way!

### How to Identify a Shape Pattern  
To identify a pattern, look for shapes that repeat in the same order. Once you find the repetition, you’ve discovered the pattern!

### Creating a Shape Pattern
Let's create a simple shape pattern together:

1. Start with a circle.
2. Add a square next to the circle.
3. Then, add a triangle after the square.
4. Repeat the sequence! 

It looks like this: Circle, Square, Triangle, Circle, Square, Triangle, and so on...

### Spotting the Rule
Our pattern rule is: “Place a circle, then a square, then a triangle, and then start with a circle again!” This rule helps us know what shape comes next.

### Example Exercises

#### Exercise 1:
Look at the pattern below and tell what shape comes next!

Triangle, Circle, Square, Triangle, Circle, _____

**Answer:** The next shape is a Square. The pattern is repeating every three shapes.

#### Exercise 2:
Can you fill in the missing shape in the pattern below?

Square, Rectangle, Rectangle, Square, _______, Rectangle

**Answer:** The missing shape is Square. The pattern repeats Square and then two Rectangles.

#### Exercise 3:
Create your own pattern using a circle, square, and triangle! Make sure to repeat the pattern at least three times.

**Example Answer:** Triangle, Square, Circle, Triangle, Square, Circle, Triangle, Square, Circle.

### Practice Making Your Own Shape Patterns

**Activity 1:** Draw a pattern using any three shapes you like. Then, show your pattern to a friend or family member and ask them to continue the pattern!

**Activity 2:** Use stickers or stamps if you have them to create a pattern in your notebook. What rule did you use to create your pattern?

Remember, patterns can get more complicated and creative the more you practice! You can use different amounts and orders of shapes as you become a pattern expert.

### Review What We Have Learned:

1. A shape pattern follows a rule.
2. Identifying the rule helps you figure out what comes next.
3. You can create your own patterns using basic shapes.
4. Patterns can repeat in simple or complex sequences.

Great job learning all about Shape Patterns! Keep practicing, and soon you’ll see patterns everywhere you look!
