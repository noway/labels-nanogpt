# Introduction to Multiplication

## Concept of Multiplication

Welcome, young mathematicians! Today, we are embarking on an exciting journey into the world of multiplication. Multiplication is one of the four basic operations in mathematics, alongside addition, subtraction, and division.

### What Is Multiplication?

At its core, multiplication is a quick way of doing repeated addition. Imagine you're at a party, and there are 5 trays of cupcakes with 4 cupcakes on each tray. Instead of adding 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 to find out how many cupcakes there are in total, we can use multiplication!

When we multiply, we are combining equal groups of things to find out how many there are altogether. In our cupcake example, we could say: 

5 (trays) multiplied by 4 (cupcakes per tray) equals 20 cupcakes.

### Terms to Know

Before we dive into practicing multiplication, let's learn a few terms that will help us:

- **Multiplicand:** The number that is to be multiplied by another number. In 5 x 4 = 20, the number 5 is the multiplicand.
- **Multiplier:** The number that the multiplicand is being multiplied by. In 5 x 4 = 20, the number 4 is the multiplier.
- **Product:** The result of multiplying two numbers together. In 5 x 4 = 20, the number 20 is the product.

### Symbols

In multiplication, we use the multiplication sign (×) or sometimes a star (*) to show that we are multiplying two numbers. For example, 3 multiplied by 2 can be written as 3 × 2 or 3 * 2.

### Examples of Multiplication

Let's look at a few examples to understand this concept better.

#### Example 1:
If there are 3 rows of trees, and each row has 4 trees, we can find the total number of trees by multiplying 3 (rows) by 4 (trees per row).

3 × 4 = 12 trees

#### Example 2:
There are 6 packs of stickers, and each pack has 5 stickers. To find the total number of stickers, we do multiplication.

6 × 5 = 30 stickers

### Practice Problems

#### Exercise 1:
7 × 3 = ?

**Answer:** The product is 21.

#### Exercise 2:
2 × 8 = ?

**Answer:** The product is 16.

#### Exercise 3:
4 × 5 = ?

**Answer:** The product is 20.

#### Exercise 4:
9 × 2 = ?

**Answer:** The product is 18.

#### Exercise 5:
How many legs do 6 four-legged chairs have altogether?
6 × 4 = ?

**Answer:** There are 24 legs altogether.

### Conclusion

Now you understand that multiplication is a way of adding the same number several times! By grouping equal amounts and using multiplication, you can find out how many items you have all together very quickly. Remember, the more you practice, the easier it becomes. Don't forget your multiplication terms: multiplicand, multiplier, and product. Have fun multiplying!
