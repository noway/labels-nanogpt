# Number Songs and Games

## Introduction
Welcome to the exciting section on "Number Songs and Games"! This part of our math practice book is dedicated to helping young learners (Kindergarten level) become friends with numbers through the power of music and play. By engaging with these fun activities, kids can naturally learn to recognize, count and understand numbers in an enjoyable and memorable way. Let's dive into some melodies and games that make numbers a delight!

## Number Songs

### 1. "The Number March"

**Song Lyrics:**

(To the tune of "The Ants Go Marching")

The numbers march one by one, hurrah, hurrah  
The numbers march one by one, hurrah, hurrah  
The numbers march one by one,  
The little one stops to have some fun  
And they all go marching down, to the ground, to learn about numbers!

The numbers march two by two, hurrah, hurrah...

(Continue the song with numbers up to ten.)

**Activities to Do with the Song:**

- March around the room with each verse, counting the numbers on your fingers.
- Stop with each "little one" in each verse and perform a fun action (e.g., jump, clap, spin).
  
**Answer Key:**

1. The children should have marched once for verse one, twice for verse two, and so on, up to ten marches, doing a fun activity after each verse.

### 2. "Five Little Ducks"

**Song Lyrics:**

Five little ducks went out one day,  
Over the hills and far away.  
Mother duck said, "Quack, quack, quack, quack."  
But only four little ducks came back.

(Follow the verses down to zero ducks, then the last verse has all the ducks come back.)

**Activities to Do with the Song:**

- Count down with your fingers as each duck goes away.
- Flap your arms like wings every time "quack, quack, quack, quack" is sung.

**Answer Key:**

1. Four ducks return after the first verse.
2. Three ducks return after the second verse.
3. Two ducks return after the third verse.
4. One duck returns after the fourth verse.
5. No ducks return after the fifth verse.
6. All five ducks return after the last verse.

## Number Games

### 3. “Number Freeze Dance”

**How to Play:**

Play some fun music and invite the children to dance. Periodically stop the music and shout out a number. When the music stops, kids must freeze in a pose that shows that number with their fingers. For example, if you shout "Three!" they should freeze with three fingers up.

**Activities to Do with the Game:**

- Encourage children to show different numbers each time the music stops.
- Praise them for showing the correct number of fingers.

**Answer Key:**

1. After each stop of the music, each student should have frozen with the correct number of fingers up to correspond with the number that was called out.

### 4. “Hopscotch Count”

**How to Play:**

Use chalk to draw a hopscotch grid on the playground. Number the squares from one to ten. Children take turns tossing a small bean bag or stone onto the grid and hop through the squares, skipping the square where their object landed, to pick it up on their way back. Each square hopped on represents a number, which the child must shout out loud.

**Activities to Do with the Game:**

- Encourage counting aloud as each child hops on a square.
- Get children to identify the number they skip when they retrieve their bean bag or stone.

**Answer Key:**

1. Each child should have counted correctly while hopping (skipping the number where their object landed).
2. Each child should have also identified the number they skipped correctly.

**Conclusion**

Through the "Number Songs and Games" section, kindergarten students have had the opportunity to incorporate numbers into their singing and physical activities. These methods are designed to ensure children associate learning numbers with fun and interactive experiences, which will solidify their foundational number knowledge and prepare them for further mathematical concepts. The answers provided will guide them to self-assessment or help teachers to assess their grasp of number recognition and counting skills. Let's keep learning and having fun with numbers!
