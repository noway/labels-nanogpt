# Welcome to Math!

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Numbers

Hello young mathematician! Welcome to the exciting world of numbers! This book is going to be your best friend as you start your journey into the land of math. Math is all around us—in the shapes of our favorite toys, in the number of apples in our fruit bowl, and even in the hours we play each day. And the very first step in learning about all this is to understand numbers.

In this section, we're going to learn about numbers, what they are, and some fun things we can do with them. Let's dive in and start our exciting adventure with numbers!

### What Are Numbers?

Numbers are symbols that tell us how many of something we have. They help us count, measure, and order things in our world. We use them in almost everything we do!

### Meet the Numbers

Let’s get to know the numbers from 0 to 10, since they are the building blocks for all other numbers. Are you ready?

- 0 (zero) – It means nothing or no amount. When you have 0 cookies, sadly, you have no cookies.
- 1 (one) – When you have just a single thing, like one nose!
- 2 (two) – If you hold up a peace sign, you’re showing the number two!
- 3 (three) – The number of sides in a triangle.
- 4 (four) – The number of wheels on a car.
- 5 (five) – The number of fingers you have on one hand.
- 6 (six) – The number of legs on an insect, like an ant.
- 7 (seven) – The days in a week.
- 8 (eight) – The number of legs on an octopus!
- 9 (nine) – One less than ten.
- 10 (ten) – If you put together all your fingers, that’s ten!

### Exercises
