# Practice Tests

---

Welcome to the Practice Tests section of your Review and Test Preparation chapter! These practice tests are designed to help you showcase what you've learned throughout the year. Try your best to solve each problem, and once you've finished, check your answers with the solutions provided at the end of the section. Remember, practice makes perfect!

Before starting, make sure you have some paper and a pencil to work out the problems. If you get stuck on a question, it's okay to look back at your notes or earlier chapters for help. You can also ask a teacher or an adult if you need more guidance. Good luck!

**Answers to Practice Test 1**

1. 345 + 289 = 634

2. 400 - 162 = 238

3. 57 x 3 = 171

10. 22 students x 4 pencils/student = 88 pencils

11. Tom has 2 x 15 marbles = 30 marbles.

12. Perimeter of a rectangle = 2(length + width) = 2(10 units + 6 units) = 2(16 units) = 32 units.

13. 3/8 as a percent is 37.5%.

14. Divide 5/9 by 2/3: (5/9) รท (2/3) = 5/9 x 3/2 = 15/18 reduced to 5/6.
