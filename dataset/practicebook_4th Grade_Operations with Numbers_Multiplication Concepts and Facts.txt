**Understanding Multiplication**

Before we dive into multiplication facts, it is important to understand what multiplication is all about. Multiplication is simply repeated addition.

For example, consider the expression:
3 x 4
This can be thought of as adding the number 3 four times. So:
3 x 4 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12

**Exercise 1: Write the addition sentence that matches the multiplication sentence.**

1. 4 x 5
2. 2 x 6
3. 7 x 3
4. 6 x 2
5. 5 x 4

**Answers:**
1. 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20
2. 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12
3. 7 + 7 + 7 = 21
4. 6 + 6 = 12
5. 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20

**Multiplication Terms**

Now let's learn some terms that are commonly used in multiplication.

- The numbers we are multiplying are called *factors*.
- The result of a multiplication is called the *product*.

In the multiplication sentence 8 x 3 = 24:
- 8 and 3 are the factors.
- 24 is the product.

**Exercise 2: Identify the factors and the product.**

1. 5 x 6 = 30
2. 7 x 4 = 28
3. 9 x 3 = 27
4. 2 x 8 = 16
5. 10 x 10 = 100

**Answers:**
1. Factors: 5 and 6; Product: 30
2. Factors: 7 and 4; Product: 28
3. Factors: 9 and 3; Product: 27
4. Factors: 2 and 8; Product: 16
5. Factors: 10 and 10; Product: 100

**Properties of Multiplication**

Multiplication has several properties that make it easier to work with numbers.

1. **Commutative Property**: This means the order in which we multiply numbers doesn't matter.
   Example: 7 x 8 = 8 x 7

2. **Associative Property**: This means when we multiply more than two numbers, the way we group them doesn't matter.
   Example: (2 x 3) x 4 = 2 x (3 x 4)

3. **Identity Property**: This is when any number multiplied by 1 gives the number itself.
   Example: 9 x 1 = 9

4. **Zero Property**: This is when any number multiplied by 0 will give a product of 0.
   Example: 5 x 0 = 0

**Exercise 3: Determine which property is used.**

1. 6 x 1 = 6
2. (7 x 3) x 2 = 7 x (3 x 2)
3. 4 x 8 = 8 x 4
4. 0 x 9 = 0

**Answers:**
1. Identity Property
2. Associative Property
3. Commutative Property
4. Zero Property

2. 8 x 2 = 16
3. 5 x 5 = 25
4. 9 x 4 = 36
5. 6 x 6 = 36
