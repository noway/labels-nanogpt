# Colors and Numbers

## Colorful Patterns

Welcome to the "Colorful Patterns" part of our workbook! By now, you’ve learned about different colors and numbers in a fun and exciting way. Patterns are all around us, and they are a way to create order and predict what comes next. Let's practice creating and recognizing patterns with colors.

### Exercise 1: Let's Make Patterns!

Patterns are made by repeating colors in a certain order. Look at the example below:

Example: Red, Blue, Red, Blue, Red, (What comes next?)

1. Yellow, Green, Yellow, Green, Yellow, ( ____ , ____ )

2. Purple, Purple, Blue, Blue, Purple, Purple, ( ____ , ____ )

3. Orange, Black, Orange, Black, Orange, ( ____ , ____ )

4. White, White, White, Pink, White, White, White, ( ____ , ____ )

**Answers:**

1. Green, Yellow
2. Blue, Blue
3. Black, Orange
4. Pink, White
5. Blue, Yellow

### Exercise 2: Color the Pattern!

Below are patterns that need to be completed by coloring. The first one in each pattern is already colored for you. Use crayons or markers to color the rest according to the pattern.

1. {🔴, ⚪️, ⚪️, 🔴, ⚪️, ⚪️, (____, ____)}

2. {⚫️, ⚫️, 🔴, ⚫️, ⚫️, 🔴, (____, ____)}

3. {🟡, ⚪️, 🟡, 🔵, 🟡, ⚪️, 🟡, (____, ____)}

Color the blanks to continue the patterns.

**Answers:**

1. Red, White
2. Black, Red
3. Blue, Yellow

### Exercise 3: Create Your Own Pattern!

Now it's your turn to be creative. Use at least three different colors to create your own pattern. Draw and color a row of at least 8 shapes to make your pattern. Remember, a pattern repeats!

Example: 🔵, 🔴, 🟢, 🔵, 🔴, 🟢, 🔵, 🔴, […]

What pattern did you create? ____________________________________________________________

### Exercise 4: Pattern Matching

Which pattern is the same as the first one? Circle the correct pattern.

Pattern A: Red, Red, Blue, Blue, Red, Red, Blue, Blue  
Pattern B: Red, Red, Blue, Red, Red, Blue, Blue  
Pattern C: Red, Blue, Blue, Red, Red, Blue, Blue  
Pattern D: Red, Blue, Red, Blue, Red, Blue, Red  

First Pattern: Red, Blue, Red, Blue, Red, Blue, Red

**Answer:**

Pattern D is the same as the first pattern.
