*(Pictures of objects in different colors are displayed. For example, a red apple, a blue ball, a yellow sun, a red car, a yellow duck, and a blue fish.)*

**Answers:**
1. Red apple to the red car
2. Blue ball to the blue fish
3. Yellow sun to the yellow duck

Great job matching colors!

**Exercise 4: Sorting by Shape**

Can you group these objects by their shape? Look at all the items below and place them into the correct shape box. Each box is labeled with the shape you need to find: circles, squares, or triangles.

*(There are images of shapes: a doughnut, a dice, a party hat, a pizza, a piece of paper, and a pyramid. There are three boxes labeled with 'circle,' 'square,' and 'triangle'.)*

**Exercise 5: Mix and Match**

This is our final game, and it's a little bit trickier! Below are objects that are all mixed up in shapes and colors. First, color them, and then sort them into two steps: first by shape into the correct column, and then by color into the correct row.

*(A chart is provided with shapes on the x-axis and colors on the y-axis, with empty boxes for the children to draw or place the colored shapes. Example shapes include a yellow star, a blue square, a red circle, a green triangle, etc.)*

**Answers:** *(Here, you would describe where each colored shape would be placed on the chart, such as the following)*
- Yellow star goes in the 'Stars' column and 'Yellow' row.
- Blue square goes in the 'Squares' column and 'Blue' row.
- Red circle goes in the 'Circles' column and 'Red' row.
- Green triangle goes in the ‘Triangles’ column and ‘Green’ row.

Congratulations! You have sorted all the objects by color and shape like a pro! Keep up the great work and remember that learning is fun!
