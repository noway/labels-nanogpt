## The Apple Orchard Adventure

### Story:
Once upon an autumn day, Mia and Max went to an apple orchard. There were 3 rows of apple trees, and each row had 5 trees. They picked 2 apples from each tree.

#### Question 1:
How many trees were in the apple orchard?

##### Answer 1:
3 rows of trees with 5 trees per row is 3 x 5 = 15 trees.

#### Question 2:
How many apples did Mia and Max pick in total?

##### Answer 2:
They picked 2 apples from each of the 15 trees, so 2 x 15 = 30 apples in total.

### Story Continues:
After gathering apples, Mia and Max sat down to rest and made new friends. They met 3 other kids at the orchard, and they all decided to share the apples equally.

#### Question 3:
How many apples did each child get?

##### Answer 3:
They had to divide 30 apples equally among 5 children, so 30 ÷ 5 = 6 apples per child.

## The Shape Parade

### Story:
In the land of Geometry, the Shape Parade was taking place. There were 4 types of shapes in the parade: triangles, circles, squares, and rectangles. Each of them had a different number of corners: triangles had 3, circles had none, squares had 4, and rectangles also had 4.

#### Question 1:
How many corners do 3 triangles have in total?

##### Answer 1:
3 triangles with 3 corners each give us 3 x 3 = 9 corners in total.

#### Question 2:
How many corners are there in 2 rectangles?

##### Answer 2:
2 rectangles with 4 corners each is 2 x 4 = 8 corners in total.

### Story Continues:
At the end of the parade, the shapes wanted to thank the number 4 for being so special, as both squares and rectangles had 4 corners.

#### Question 3:
How many shapes in total thanked the number 4?

##### Answer 3:
If there were 4 squares and 3 rectangles, that would be 4 + 3 = 7 shapes thanking the number 4.

## The Counting Tea Party

### Story:
Ellie the Elephant was having a tea party. She invited 2 of her stuffed animal friends: Teddy the Bear and Dolly the Doll. Ellie had 5 cookies, Teddy brought 3 cookies, and Dolly had 2 cookies.

#### Question 1:
How many cookies were there at the tea party in total?

##### Answer 1:
Ellie’s 5 cookies with Teddy’s 3 cookies and Dolly’s 2 cookies make 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 cookies in total.

#### Question 2:
If Ellie ate 2 cookies, how many cookies were left?

##### Answer 2:
After eating 2 cookies from the initial 10, there would be 10 - 2 = 8 cookies left.

### Story Continues:
After the party, Ellie wanted to give 2 cookies to each of her friends as a thank-you gift.

#### Question 3:
Could Ellie give 2 cookies to each friend if she only had 8 cookies left? Why or why not?

##### Answer 3:
Yes, 2 cookies for Teddy and 2 for Dolly would be 2 x 2 = 4 cookies in total. Ellie would have enough because 8 - 4 = 4 cookies would remain for her.
