**Section: Mean, Median, Mode**

**Mean (Average)**

When we talk about the *mean* in mathematics, we're usually referring to what people often call the "average." To find the mean of a set of numbers, you follow these steps:

1. **Add** up all the numbers in your set.
2. **Divide** the sum by the number of numbers you added.

This gives you the mean!

*Example:*

Find the mean of the following set of numbers: 4, 8, 6, 3, 5.

**Step 1:** Add the numbers together.
4 + 8 + 6 + 3 + 5 = 26

**Step 2:** Divide the sum by the number of numbers (in this example, there are 5 numbers).
26 ÷ 5 = 5.2

So, the mean of the numbers is 5.2.

**Exercise 1:**
Find the mean of the following numbers: 7, 9, 5, 8, 10.

**Answer to Exercise 1:**
(7 + 9 + 5 + 8 + 10) ÷ 5 = 39 ÷ 5 = 7.8

**Median**

The median is the "middle value" in a list of numbers. To find the median, you need to:

1. Arrange the numbers in order from the smallest to the largest.
2. Find the number that is exactly in the middle of the list. If there is an even number of observations, find the average of the two middle numbers.

*Example:*

Find the median of the following numbers: 7, 5, 3, 9.

**Step 1:** Arrange the numbers in order.
3, 5, 7, 9

**Step 2:** Since there are an even number of numbers, take the middle two (5 and 7) and find their average.
(5 + 7) ÷ 2 = 12 ÷ 2 = 6

So, the median of the numbers is 6.

**Exercise 2:**
Find the median of these numbers: 12, 3, 8, 4, 10, 15.

**Answer to Exercise 2:**
First, arrange the numbers: 3, 4, 8, 10, 12, 15.
The middle numbers are 8 and 10, so the median is (8 + 10) ÷ 2 = 18 ÷ 2 = 9.

**Mode**

The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a list of numbers. It's possible to have more than one mode or to have no mode at all.

*Example:*

Find the mode of the following set of numbers: 3, 7, 3, 2, 5, 2.

The number 3 appears twice, and the number 2 appears twice. No other number appears more than that.

So, the mode of the numbers is 2 and 3. This is called bimodal because there are two modes.

**Exercise 3:**
Find the mode of these numbers: 11, 8, 8, 11, 8, 9, 4.

**Answer to Exercise 3:**
The number 8 appears three times, more than any other number.

So the mode is 8.

Now, let's practice what we've learned about mean, median, and mode. Try the exercises below, and check your answers with the ones provided:

**Exercise 4:**
Find the mean, median, and mode of the following numbers: 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9.

**Answer to Exercise 4:**
Mean: (2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 9) ÷ 8 = 40 ÷ 8 = 5
Median: The middle numbers are 4 and 5, so (4 + 5) ÷ 2 = 9 ÷ 2 = 4.5
Mode: The number 4 appears most frequently, so the mode is 4.

**Exercise 5:**
Find the mean, median, and mode of these numbers: 12, 16, 12, 16, 14, 18, 16.

**Answer to Exercise 5:**
Mean: (12 + 16 + 12 + 16 + 14 + 18 + 16) ÷ 7 = 104 ÷ 7 ≈ 14.86
Median: Arrange the numbers: 12, 12, 14, 16, 16, 16, 18. The median is 16.
Mode: The number 16 appears most frequently, so the mode is 16.

Remember, practicing these concepts helps you understand them better. Keep practicing with different sets of numbers until you feel confident with finding the mean, median, and mode.
