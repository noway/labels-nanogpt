# Reviewing Key Concepts

As we finish our chapter, it's important to review the key concepts that we have learned. This section will help kindergarten students reinforce their understanding of the basic mathematical skills we've worked on. Remember, practice makes perfect!

#### 1. Counting to 10

Counting is the foundation of math. Let's count from 1 to 10 together!

**Exercise:** Fill in the missing numbers:

1, 2, __, 4, __, 6, __, 8, __, 10.

**Answer:**  
1, 2, **3**, 4, **5**, 6, **7**, 8, **9**, 10.

#### 2. Recognizing Numbers

Being able to recognize numbers helps us understand how many objects we have.

**Exercise:** Circle the number that shows how many apples are in the basket.

🍎🍎 (Numbers to choose from: 1, 2, 3).

**Answer:**  
The circled number is **2** because there are two apples.

#### 3. Shapes

Knowing shapes is an important part of math. We can find shapes everywhere!

**Exercise:** Draw a line from the shape to its name.

(Triangle, Square, Circle)

**Answer:**

- Triangle ⬅️ (A shape with three sides)
- Square ⬅️ (A shape with four equal sides) 
- Circle ⬅️ (A shape with no sides)

#### 4. Comparing Sizes

It's useful to be able to tell if one thing is bigger or smaller than another.

**Exercise:** Circle the bigger object (a larger circle next to a smaller one).

**Answer:**  
The larger circle is circled.

#### 5. Patterns

Patterns are sequences that repeat themselves. Can you see what comes next?

**Exercise:** What comes next in the pattern?

🔵🔴🔵🔴🔵__?

**Answer:**  
🔴 (The pattern is blue, red, blue, red, blue, red).

#### 6. Sorting and Categorizing

Sorting objects helps us see what they have in common.

**Exercise:** Draw a line to sort the objects into the right group.

(Fruits: Apple, Banana. Animals: Cat, Dog).

**Answer:**  
- Apple, Banana ➡️ Fruits
- Cat, Dog ➡️ Animals

#### 7. Simple Addition

Adding is when we put groups of things together to find out how many there are in total.

**Exercise:** 2 + 3 = ?

**Answer:**  
2 + 3 = **5**

#### 8. Simple Subtraction

Subtraction is when we take away some things from a group to see how many are left.

**Exercise:** 5 - 2 = ?

**Answer:**  
5 - 2 = **3**
