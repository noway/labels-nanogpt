**What is Subtraction?**

Subtraction is an important math skill that you will be learning about. It means taking away one number from another. When you subtract, you find out how many are left when you remove some things from a group. It's just like when you have some cookies, and you eat a few—there are fewer cookies left!

Imagine you have a basket of apples. If you take some out, your basket doesn't have as many apples as before. That's subtraction!

We use a special sign for subtraction—the minus sign (−). When you see this sign, it means that you need to subtract one number from another. The answer you get after subtracting is called the "difference."

**Exercise 1: Practice Subtraction**  
Below are some practice problems. Try to solve them on your own, and then check your answers!

Remember, subtraction looks like this:

5 - 2 = 3

This means if you have five items and you take away two, you're left with three.

1. 4 - 2 =  
_Answer: 2_  

2. 7 - 5 =  
_Answer: 2_  

3. 6 - 3 =  
_Answer: 3_  

4. 5 - 1 =  
_Answer: 4_

5. 10 - 6 =  
_Answer: 4_

**Exercise 2: Subtraction Stories**  
Subtraction can also be explained through stories. Let's read some short stories and understand how subtraction works in them.

1. **Cookie Story**  
    Tim had 8 cookies. He gave 3 cookies to his friend. How many cookies does Tim have left?  
    _Story Answer: 5 cookies_  

2. **Toy Cars Story**  
    Jenna had 9 toy cars. She lost 2 of them. How many toy cars does Jenna have now?  
    _Story Answer: 7 toy cars_

3. **Pencils Story**  
    Amir had 10 pencils. He gave 4 pencils to his classmate. How many pencils does Amir have now?  
    _Story Answer: 6 pencils_

4. **Books Story**  
    Sara had 7 books. She donated 2 books to the library. How many books does Sara have left?  
    _Story Answer: 5 books_

**Exercise 3: Drawing Subtraction**  
For this activity, draw objects to help you subtract. Draw the objects, cross out the ones you take away, and count what's left.

1. 6 flowers - 2 flowers =  
_Answer: 4 flowers left_  
   (Draw 6 flowers, cross out 2, and count the remaining ones.)

2. 5 balloons - 3 balloons =  
_Answer: 2 balloons left_  
   (Draw 5 balloons, cross out 3, and count the remaining ones.)

3. 8 blocks - 4 blocks =  
_Answer: 4 blocks left_  
   (Draw 8 blocks, cross out 4, and count the remaining ones.)

As you learn about subtraction, you will find that it helps you understand how numbers change when something is taken away. It's very useful in everyday life, like when you're sharing snacks, measuring ingredients for a recipe, or counting how many days are left until a special event!

Keep practicing these subtraction stories, and soon you'll be a subtraction star!
