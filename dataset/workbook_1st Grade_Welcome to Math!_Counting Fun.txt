**Chapter: Counting Fun**

Hello there, little mathematician! Get ready for an exciting journey into the world of numbers. In this section, we're going to have so much fun with counting. Counting helps us know how many of something there is - like how many apples are in a basket or how many fingers on your hand. 

Let's start with some simple and thrilling exercises that you can do to become a counting superstar.

**Exercise 1: Counting from 1 to 10**

Great job! Counting up to 10 is so much fun, isn't it?

**Exercise 2: Counting Objects**
Below are some pictures of different objects. Let’s count how many of each object there are. Write the number below each group.

Apples: 🍎🍎🍎🍎🍎 (Draw a line from the group of apples to the number 5.)

Balloons: 🎈🎈🎈 (Draw a line from the group of balloons to the number 3.)

Cats: 🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱 (Draw a line from the group of cats to the number 7.)

You did it! You found all the missing numbers. You're a counting hero!

**Exercise 4: More than and Less than**
Let’s compare some numbers. Can you circle the group that has more objects and underline the one with fewer objects?

Set A: ⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽ (5 soccer balls)   Set B: 🏀🏀🏀🏀 (4 basketballs)
