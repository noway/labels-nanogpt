# Simple Addition (1-20)

Welcome to the Simple Addition section, young mathematicians! Addition is a way of finding out how much you have in total when you put groups of things together. Imagine you have some delicious apples and you get some more from a friend. If you want to know how many apples you have altogether, you would use addition to find out!

In this section, weâ€™re going to practice adding numbers together that are between 1 and 20. Remember, when you add, the order of the numbers doesn't matter; the total will be the same. This is called the Commutative Property of Addition (for example, 4 + 3 is the same as 3 + 4).

Let's start by adding some small numbers. Don't forget to write the sum (the answer to an addition problem) on the line provided.

**Exercise 1:**

1. 3 + 1 = ___
2. 5 + 2 = ___
3. 2 + 4 = ___
4. 7 + 1 = ___
5. 6 + 3 = ___

**Answers to Exercise 1:**

1. 3 + 1 = 4
2. 5 + 2 = 7
3. 2 + 4 = 6
4. 7 + 1 = 8
5. 6 + 3 = 9

Great job! Now, let's try some that are a little harder.

**Exercise 2:**

1. 8 + 5 = ___
2. 10 + 6 = ___
3. 7 + 9 = ___
4. 11 + 3 = ___
5. 12 + 7 = ___

**Answers to Exercise 2:**

1. 8 + 5 = 13
2. 10 + 6 = 16
3. 7 + 9 = 16
4. 11 + 3 = 14
5. 12 + 7 = 19

Fantastic! Remember, you can use your fingers, draw pictures, or use counters to help you add if you need to.

**Exercise 3:

Let's mix them up a bit. Complete these addition problems created with random numbers between 1 and 20.

1. 4 + 14 = ___
2. 13 + 5 = ___
3. 19 + 1 = ___
4. 16 + 2 = ___
5. 9 + 6 = ___

**Answers to Exercise 3:**

1. 4 + 14 = 18
2. 13 + 5 = 18
3. 19 + 1 = 20
4. 16 + 2 = 18
5. 9 + 6 = 15

Excellent work! See how you can add all these different numbers and get the right sums? Now, for a quick challenge, let's move onto some story problems.

**Exercise 4: Story Problems**

1. Sarah has 5 red balloons and 2 blue balloons. How many balloons does she have in total?
2. If there are 4 birds on a tree and 3 more birds fly to join them, how many birds are on the tree now?
3. Alex reads 10 pages of his book in the morning and 7 more pages in the afternoon. How many pages did Alex read today?
4. Emma puts 8 carrots in a pot and then adds 5 more carrots. How many carrots are in the pot altogether?
5. A dog has 6 bones, but then his owner gives him another 9 bones. How many bones does the dog have now?

**Answers to Exercise 4: Story Problems**

1. 5 + 2 = 7 (Sarah has 7 balloons in total.)
2. 4 + 3 = 7 (There are 7 birds on the tree now.)
3. 10 + 7 = 17 (Alex read 17 pages today.)
4. 8 + 5 = 13 (There are 13 carrots in the pot altogether.)
5. 6 + 9 = 15 (The dog has 15 bones now.)

You did a fantastic job with these simple addition problems! With these skills, you're well on your way to becoming a math superstar. Keep practicing, and you'll keep getting better and better. Remember, practice makes perfect!
