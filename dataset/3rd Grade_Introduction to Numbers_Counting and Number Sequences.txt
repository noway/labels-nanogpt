### What is Counting?

Counting is the action of finding out how many of something there are. It involves saying numbers in order, one by one, as you point to objects. 

Think of it as if you are going up the stairs. Each step you take, you go one step higher, and you can count each of those steps.

Let's practice counting! Look around you and pick some objects to count. It could be anything â€“ crayons, apples, or even your fingers!

#### Example Exercise 1:
Count the number of stars:
âœ¦ âœ¦ âœ¦ âœ¦ âœ¦ 

**Answer:** There are 5 stars.

### Number Sequences

A number sequence is a list of numbers that follow a certain pattern or rule. 

An example of a basic number sequence is counting by ones starting from 1:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...

Or you can start from any other number, like 5:

5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14...

Can you see the pattern? Each number increases by one from the previous number.

#### Example Exercise 2:
Write the next five numbers in this sequence:
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, ____, ____, ____, ____, ____

**Answer:** 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

### Skip Counting

Skip counting is when you count forward or backwards by a number larger than one. You can skip count by twos, threes, fives, tens, and so on.

#### Counting by Twos:
This sequence shows counting by twos, starting from 2:

2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20...

#### Example Exercise 3:
Now, you try to skip count by twos, starting from 6:
6, ____, ____, ____, ____, ____

**Answer:** 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16.

#### Counting by Fives:
Hereâ€™s what counting by fives, starting from 5, looks like:

5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50...

#### Example Exercise 4:
Can you count by fives, starting from 10?
10, ____, ____, ____, ____, ____

**Answer:** 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35.

#### Counting by Tens:
And here is what counting by tens, starting from 10, looks like:

10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100...

#### Example Exercise 5:
Your turn! Count by tens, starting from 20:
20, ____, ____, ____, ____, ____

**Answer:** 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70.

### Exercises Recap:

Great job practicing counting and number sequences! Now letâ€™s recap what weâ€™ve learned:

1. **Counting** is saying numbers in order to find out how many objects there are.
2. **Number sequences** are lists of numbers that follow a pattern or rule. You can make a number sequence by starting from any number and adding one to get the next.
3. **Skip Counting** is like hopping over some numbers on your way up the steps. You can skip count by any number, but we practiced skip counting by twos, fives, and tens.

Always remember to say numbers in the right order, and if you get stuck, just think about what comes next â€“ you can always use your fingers or objects around you to keep track.

Keep practicing, and soon, you'll be a counting star! ðŸŒŸ
