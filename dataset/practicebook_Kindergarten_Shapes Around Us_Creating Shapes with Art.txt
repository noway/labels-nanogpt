# Shapes Around Us: "Creating Shapes with Art" - Kindergarten Level K-12

## Introduction:

Welcome, students, to the "Creating Shapes with Art" section of the "Shapes Around Us" chapter! In this section, we are going to have fun with shapes by creating them through different art projects. We'll not only learn the names of the shapes but also practice drawing them and recognize these shapes in the objects around us.

## Lesson 1: Basic Shapes and How to Draw Them

### Circle:
- **Definition**: A circle is a round shape with no corners and no sides. It looks the same from all directions.
- **How to Draw**: Start by gently drawing a round shape. You can trace around a round object like a coin or cup to make a perfect circle.

### Square:
- **Definition**: A square has four equal sides and four right angles.
- **How to Draw**: Draw a straight line and then make another line at a right angle (90 degrees) to the first one. Continue this until you have four sides and close the shape by connecting the last side to the first one.

### Triangle:
- **Definition**: A triangle has three sides and can be of various shapes: equilateral (all sides equal), isosceles (two sides equal), or scalene (no sides equal).
- **How to Draw**: Draw three lines that connect at the ends, forming a shape with three angles.

### Rectangle:
- **Definition**: A rectangle has four sides with opposite sides equal in length and has four right angles.
- **How to Draw**: Similar to the square but with two longer sides and two shorter sides. Make sure the angles are right angles (90 degrees).

**Answers to Drawing Exercise**  
- The circle should look like a round disc.
- The square should have four equal sides and look like a box.
- The triangle examples should show each type, with the sides different or the same depending on the type.
- The rectangle should look like a door or a picture frame with longer top and bottom sides.

## Lesson 2: Creating Shapes with Art Supplies

### Exercise: Shape Collage
**Materials Needed**: Construction paper, scissors, glue
1. Cut out shapes: circles, squares, triangles, and rectangles from different colored papers.
2. Arrange the shapes to make a picture or a pattern on a larger sheet of paper.
3. Glue the shapes down to create your collage.

### Answer Key:
- Circle collage might resemble balloons or wheels.
- Square collage could look like a checkerboard or a quilt.
- Triangle collage might look like a forest of trees or mountain range.
- Rectangle collage could resemble a city skyline with buildings.

## Lesson 3: Finding Shapes in Art

### Exercise: Shape Hunt
1. Look at different pictures in books or artwork around the classroom.
2. Identify and list the shapes you see in the art.

### Answer Key:
- In a picture of a landscape, students might find:
  - Circles in the sun or in fruits on trees.
  - Squares in windows of houses.
  - Triangles in the peaks of mountains.
  - Rectangles in the trunks of trees or doors of houses.

## Lesson 4: Completing Shapes in Art

### Exercise: Finish the Picture
**Materials Needed**: Pre-drawn pictures with missing shapes (e.g., a house without windows, a car without wheels)
1. Draw in the missing circles, squares, triangles, and rectangles to complete the pictures.

### Answer Key:
- For a house, the windows could be squares, the door a rectangle, and the roof a triangle.
- For a car, the wheels would be circles, and the body could be a rectangle with a triangle front for the hood.

## Conclusion:
Now that you've completed the "Creating Shapes with Art" section, you should be more familiar with drawing basic shapes and recognizing them in artwork. Shapes are everywhere, and being able to identify and create them is a fundamental skill in both math and art. Keep practicing, and don't forget to look for shapes in the world around you!
