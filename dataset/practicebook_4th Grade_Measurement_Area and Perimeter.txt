## Understanding Area

**Area** is the size of a surface. It is measured in square units, such as square inches (in²), square feet (ft²), or square meters (m²).

### Calculating Area

For a **rectangle** or **square**:
Area = Length × Width

For example:
If a rectangle has a length of 6 inches and a width of 4 inches, the area is:
Area = 6 in × 4 in = 24 in²

### Practice Problems: Area

1. Find the area of a rectangle with a length of 8 inches and a width of 5 inches.
2. Calculate the area of a square with sides measuring 7 inches.
3. What is the area of a rectangle with a length of 12 feet and a width of 9 feet?

---

### Answers: Area

1. 8 in × 5 in = 40 in²
2. 7 in × 7 in = 49 in²
3. 12 ft × 9 ft = 108 ft²

## Understanding Perimeter

**Perimeter** is the total length of the sides of a two-dimensional shape.

### Calculating Perimeter

For a **rectangle**:
Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)

For a **square** (since all sides are equal):
Perimeter = 4 × Side

### Practice Problems: Perimeter

1. Find the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 10 meters and a width of 6 meters.
2. Calculate the perimeter of a square with sides measuring 9 centimeters.
3. What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 14 feet and a width of 11 feet?

---

### Answers: Perimeter

1. Perimeter = 2 × (10 m + 6 m) = 2 × 16 m = 32 m
2. Perimeter = 4 × 9 cm = 36 cm
3. Perimeter = 2 × (14 ft + 11 ft) = 2 × 25 ft = 50 ft

## Mixed Practice Problems

Let’s put your knowledge to the test with some mixed problems that require calculating both area and perimeter.

1. A rectangle has a length of 15 inches and a width of 10 inches. Find both the area and the perimeter.
2. A square has sides of 8 meters. Calculate its area and perimeter.
3. A rectangle has a perimeter of 24 centimeters. If the length is 10 centimeters, what is the width and the area?

---

### Answers: Mixed Practice Problems

1. Area = 15 in × 10 in = 150 in², Perimeter = 2 × (15 in + 10 in) = 2 × 25 in = 50 in
2. Area = 8 m × 8 m = 64 m², Perimeter = 4 × 8 m = 32 m
3. Width = 24 cm ÷ 2 - 10 cm = 12 cm - 10 cm = 2 cm, Area = 10 cm × 2 cm = 20 cm²
