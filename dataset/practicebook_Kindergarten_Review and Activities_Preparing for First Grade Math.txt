Let's review what we learned:

- Counting objects and writing numbers helps us understand quantity.
- Recognizing and drawing basic shapes allows us to understand geometry around us.
- Pattern recognition helps us predict what comes next based on the given order.
- Addition and subtraction are the foundations of arithmetic that involve putting together and taking apart numbers.
- Comparing quantities teaches us about more and less.
- Story problems help us apply math to real-life situations.

Keep practicing these math concepts, and you'll be well-prepared for first grade! Great job on completing these activities!
