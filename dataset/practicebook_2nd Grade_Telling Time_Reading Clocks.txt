# Reading Clocks

Welcome young time-traveler! In this section of our "Telling Time" chapter, we are going on an adventure to learn how to read clocks. Clocks are tools that help us know what part of the day it is; morning, afternoon, evening, or night. By understanding clocks, we can be punctual for school, parties, and all the fun activities we do!

## Understanding the Clock Face

Most clocks have three hands and a face that has numbers 1 to 12. These are the parts we need to pay close attention to:

- **The Hour Hand** is the shorter hand. It tells us which hour it is.
- **The Minute Hand** is the longer hand. It shows us how many minutes have passed within the hour.
- **The Second Hand** moves the fastest, and it counts the seconds. But don't worry; for now, we'll focus on hours and minutes.
