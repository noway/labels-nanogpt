# Chapter 5: Time for Time

**Section 3: Learning about Hours**

Hello, young mathematicians! Today, we are going to learn about hours. An hour is a way to measure time. There are 24 hours in a day! That might seem like a lot, but we use hours all the time to know when to wake up, go to school, eat, play, and sleep.

**What is an Hour?**
An hour is a block of time. Just like there are 60 minutes in an hour, there are 24 hours in a day. When you look at the clock and it moves from one number to the next, that’s one hour passing by.

**How Many Hours?**
- When you're at school, how many hours do you spend there? Maybe about 7 hours!
- If you sleep for 8 hours, how much time is that? That’s right, 8 hours!

**AM and PM**

*AM* stands for the hours from midnight to noon (12:00 AM to 11:59 AM).
*PM* stands for the hours from noon to midnight (12:00 PM to 11:59 PM).

**Exercise 1: Drawing the Clock**

1. Draw a big circle. This is your clock face.
2. Write the number 12 at the top of your circle.
3. Now, write the number 6 at the bottom.
4. Write the number 3 on the right side and the number 9 on the left side.
5. Fill in the rest of the numbers. Remember, there are 12 numbers on a clock!

**Exercise 2: Telling the Hour**

1. When the little hand points to 8 and the big hand points to 12, what time is it?
   - Answer: It’s 8 o'clock!

2. If the little hand points to 3 and the big hand points to 12, what time is it now?
   - Answer: It’s 3 o'clock!

3. When you start school and the little hand is on the 9 and the big hand is on the 12, what hour is starting?
   - Answer: The 9th hour is starting, so it’s 9 o'clock!

**Exercise 3: Guessing Game**

I will tell you what I do and you guess what hour it is:

1. I eat dinner with my family.
    - *Possible Answers:* That depends! Some people eat dinner around 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock PM.

2. I brush my teeth and get ready for bed.
    - *Possible Answers:* Perhaps you do this at 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock PM.

3. I have lunch right after playtime ends.
    - *Possible Answers:* That could be around 12 o'clock PM or maybe 1 o'clock PM.

**Activity: Hours in a Day**

Draw a big circle and divide it into 24 slices, like a pizza. Each slice is an hour. Can you fill in what you do in each hour? Here’s an example:

12 AM - 7 AM: Sleeping
7 AM - 8 AM: Getting ready for school
8 AM – 3 PM: School Time
3 PM - 4 PM: Homework Time
4 PM - 5 PM: Play Time
5 PM – 6 PM: Dinner Time
6 PM - 7 PM: Family Time
7 PM – 8 PM: Bath and Bedtime Routine
8 PM - 12 AM: Sleeping

Now, it's your turn! After you fill in your circle, share it with a friend or your family. Do they do the same things at the same hours?

Remember, knowing about hours and how to tell them apart is very useful. Whether you're scheduling your playtime, or figuring out when a TV show starts, hours help us organize our day. Keep practicing, and soon you'll be a master of time!
