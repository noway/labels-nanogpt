# Using Math at Home

Welcome to the "Using Math at Home" section of the "Me and My Math" chapter! Math is all around us, even in our homes. Every day, you use math without even thinking about it, like counting toys, helping set the table, or sharing snacks with friends. In this section, we will explore some fun and easy math activities you can do at home to practice what you've learned.
