# Comparing and Ordering Numbers

Welcome, young mathematicians, to the section on Comparing and Ordering Numbers! Learning how to compare and order numbers is essential because it helps us understand their size relative to each other. This skill will be a great tool when you're solving problems inside and outside the math classroom.

### Understanding Greater Than, Less Than, and Equal To

When we compare two numbers, we're trying to find out which number is greater, which is smaller, or if they are equal to each other. To do this, we use three important symbols:

1. The greater than symbol (>)
2. The less than symbol (<)
3. The equal to symbol (=)

#### Greater Than (>)
The symbol ">" means that one number is larger than another. When we say that 7 is greater than 5, we write it as 7 > 5.

#### Less Than (<)
The symbol "<" means that one number is smaller than another. For example, 3 is less than 4, so we write it as 3 < 4.

#### Equal To (=)
The symbol "=" is probably one you're already familiar with. It means that two numbers are the same in value. So, if we have four apples and four oranges, we can say 4 = 4.

### Practice Comparing Numbers

**Exercise 1:** Write the correct symbol (<, >, or =) in the blank.

1. 7 _ 9
2. 12 _ 12
3. 5 _ 8

**Answers:**

1. 7 < 9 (7 is less than 9)
2. 12 = 12 (12 is equal to 12)
3. 5 < 8 (5 is less than 8)

**Exercise 2:** Compare the pairs of numbers and decide which is greater.

1. 256, 265
2. 423, 432
3. 555, 555

**Answers:**

1. 256 < 265
2. 423 < 432
3. 555 = 555

### Ordering Numbers

When ordering numbers, you can arrange them from smallest to largest (ascending order) or from largest to smallest (descending order). Let's practice both ways.

#### Ascending Order (From Smallest to Largest)

To put numbers in ascending order, you start with the smallest number and end with the largest.

**Example:** Put these numbers in ascending order: 34, 56, 23, 45.

**Answer:** 23, 34, 45, 56

#### Descending Order (From Largest to Smallest)

Descending order is the opposite of ascending order. You start with the largest number and end with the smallest.

**Example:** Arrange the following numbers in descending order: 78, 67, 89, 45.

**Answer:** 89, 78, 67, 45

### Practice Ordering Numbers

**Exercise 3:** Arrange the following sets of numbers in ascending order.

1. 487, 478, 874
2. 321, 213, 123
3. 655, 565, 556

**Exercise 4:** Arrange the following sets of numbers in descending order.

1. 278, 287, 872
2. 732, 327, 273
3. 999, 919, 991

**Answers to Exercise 3:**

1. 478, 487, 874
2. 123, 213, 321
3. 556, 565, 655

**Answers to Exercise 4:**

1. 872, 287, 278
2. 732, 327, 273
3. 999, 991, 919

**Try This!**

Using what you've learned, compare and order the following numbers for extra practice. Remember to include the correct symbols when comparing, and to write the numbers out in order when ordering.

1. Compare: 102, 201
2. Order ascending: 394, 439, 349
3. Order descending: 560, 506, 605

Keep practicing these skills, and you'll be a number comparison expert in no time! These abilities will help you with money, measuring, time, and so many other important everyday tasks. Have fun with numbers, and don't be afraid to challenge yourself with more complex sets of numbers as you grow more comfortable with this topic.
