   - **Example:** 9 + 1 = 10

6. **Not Equal (≠)**
   - The not equal symbol '≠' indicates that the value on the left is different from the value on the right.
   - **Example:** 4 + 2 ≠ 7

7. **Less Than (<)**
   - The less than symbol '<' denotes that the number on the left is smaller than the number on the right.
   - **Example:** 3 < 5

8. **Greater Than (>)**
   - The greater than symbol '>' shows that the number on the left is larger than the number on the right.
   - **Example:** 6 > 4

9. **Less Than or Equal To (≤)**
   - The less than or equal to symbol '≤' means the number on the left is smaller or equal to the number on the right.
   - **Example:** 4 ≤ 4

10. **Greater Than or Equal To (≥)**
    - The greater than or equal to symbol '≥' denotes that the number on the left is larger or equal to the number on the right.
    - **Example:** 5 ≥ 3

11. **Parentheses (())**
    - Parentheses are used to indicate which operations should be performed first.
    - **Example:** (2 + 3) × 4 = 20

12. **Number Line**
    - A visual representation of numbers on a straight line, showing their order and spacing.
    - **Example:** A number line with points labeled 0 through 10.

#### Terms

1. **Addend**
   - An addend is any number being added.
   - **Example Answer:** In 5 + 9 = 14, both 5 and 9 are addends.

2. **Sum**
   - The sum is the result of adding two or more addends.
   - **Example Answer:** The sum of 5 + 9 is 14.

3. **Minuend**
   - The minuend is the number from which another number (the subtrahend) is subtracted.
   - **Example Answer:** In 10 − 4 = 6, 10 is the minuend.

4. **Subtrahend**
   - The subtrahend is the number that is being subtracted from the minuend.
   - **Example Answer:** In 10 − 4 = 6, 4 is the subtrahend.

5. **Difference**
   - The difference is the result of subtracting one number from another.
   - **Example Answer:** The difference of 10 − 4 is 6.

6. **Multiplier**
   - The multiplier is the number that is multiplying another number (the multiplicand).
   - **Example Answer:** In 3 × 7 = 21, 3 is the multiplier.

7. **Multiplicand**
   - The multiplicand is the number being multiplied by the multiplier.
   - **Example Answer:** In 3 × 7 = 21, 7 is the multiplicand.

10. **Divisor**
    - The divisor is the number by which another number (the dividend) is divided.
    - **Example Answer:** In 12 ÷ 3 = 4, 3 is the divisor.

11. **Quotient**
    - The quotient is the result of a division problem.
    - **Example Answer:** The quotient of 12 ÷ 3 is 4.

12. **Fraction**
    - A way to express a number that represents a part of a whole.
    - **Example Answer:** In the fraction ½, 1 is the numerator and 2 is the denominator.

13. **Numerator**
    - The top part of a fraction which indicates how many parts are taken from the whole.
    - **Example Answer:** In ¾, 3 is the numerator.

14. **Denominator**
    - The bottom part of a fraction which shows how many equal parts the whole is divided into.
    - **Example Answer:** In ¾, 4 is the denominator.

15. **Equivalent Fractions**
    - Fractions that have different numerators and denominators but represent the same value.
    - **Example Answer:** ½ and 2/4 are equivalent fractions.

16. **Decimal**
    - A number that has a whole part and a fractional part separated by a decimal point.
    - **Example Answer:** 7.25 is a decimal.

17. **Place Value**
