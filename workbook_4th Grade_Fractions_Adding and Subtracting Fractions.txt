# Adding and Subtracting Fractions

Welcome to the exciting world of fractions! In this chapter, we are going to explore how to add and subtract fractions. Remember, fractions are a way of representing parts of a whole. Understanding fractions will help you in math, in cooking, in measuring, and in many other real-life situations. Let's dive in!

## Understanding Fractions

Before we begin adding and subtracting fractions, we need to understand what a fraction is. A fraction has two parts: the numerator (the top number) and the denominator (the bottom number). The denominator tells us how many equal parts the whole is divided into, and the numerator tells us how many of those parts we have.

For example, in the fraction 3/4, 4 is the denominator and tells us that the whole is divided into 4 equal parts. 3 is the numerator and tells us we have 3 of those 4 parts.

## Adding Fractions with the Same Denominator

**Step 1:** Make sure the fractions have the same denominator.

**Step 2:** Add the numerators and put the sum over the common denominator.

**Step 3:** Simplify the fraction if possible.

### Example 1:
Add 1/4 + 2/4

**Step 1:** The denominators are the same (4).
**Step 2:** Add the numerators: 1 + 2 = 3
**Step 3:** Place the sum over the common denominator: 3/4
So, 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4.

## Subtracting Fractions with the Same Denominator

**Step 1:** Make sure the fractions have the same denominator.

**Step 2:** Subtract the second numerator from the first numerator and put the difference over the common denominator.

**Step 3:** Simplify the fraction if possible.

### Example 2:
Subtract 3/8 - 1/8

**Step 1:** The denominators are the same (8).
**Step 2:** Subtract the numerators: 3 - 1 = 2
**Step 3:** Place the difference over the common denominator: 2/8
**Step 4:** Simplify: 2/8 = 1/4 (Both 2 and 8 can be divided by 2)
So, 3/8 - 1/8 = 1/4.

## Adding Fractions with Different Denominators

**Step 1:** Find a common denominator for the fractions.

**Step 2:** Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the common denominator.

**Step 3:** Add the numerators and put the sum over the common denominator.

**Step 4:** Simplify the fraction if possible.

### Example 3:
Add 1/3 + 1/4

**Step 1:** The common denominator for 3 and 4 is 12.
**Step 2:** Convert each fraction:
- 1/3 = 4/12 (Multiply both numerator and denominator by 4)
- 1/4 = 3/12 (Multiply both numerator and denominator by 3)
**Step 3:** Add the numerators: 4 + 3 = 7
**Step 4:** Place the sum over the common denominator: 7/12
So, 1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12.

## Subtracting Fractions with Different Denominators

**Step 1:** Find a common denominator for the fractions.

**Step 2:** Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the common denominator.

**Step 3:** Subtract the second numerator from the first numerator and put the difference over the common denominator.

**Step 4:** Simplify the fraction if possible.

### Example 4:
Subtract 2/3 - 1/6

**Step 1:** The common denominator for 3 and 6 is 6.
**Step 2:** Convert each fraction:
- 2/3 = 4/6 (Multiply both numerator and denominator by 2)
**Step 3:** The second fraction is already at the common denominator: 1/6
Now we have: 4/6 - 1/6
**Step 4:** Subtract the numerators: 4 - 1 = 3
**Step 5:** Place the difference over the common denominator: 3/6
**Step 6:** Simplify: 3/6 = 1/2 (Both 3 and 6 can be divided by 3)
So, 2/3 - 1/6 = 1/2.
