# Basic Addition and Subtraction

## Simple Subtraction (1-20)

Welcome to the Simple Subtraction section! Subtraction is an important math skill that you can master with some practice. Here, we'll practice subtracting numbers from 1 to 20. Remember, when we subtract, we take away a certain number from another to find out what's left.

Let's look at some examples and solve these subtraction problems together!

### Subtraction Practice

**Example 1:**
10 - 3 = ?

To solve this, you start with 10 and take away 3. Counting down from 10, we get 9, then 8, then 7. 
So, 10 - 3 = 7.

**Example 2:**
6 - 4 = ?

Starting with 6, take away 4. That leaves us with 2.
So, 6 - 4 = 2.

Great job! Now, letâ€™s go through some practice exercises. Fill in the blanks with the correct answer.
