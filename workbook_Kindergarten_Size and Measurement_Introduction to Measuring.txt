Introduction to Measuring

Welcome to the exciting world of measuring! Measuring is a way to find out how long or tall something is, how much it weighs, or how much it holds. When we measure, we compare things to see which is bigger, smaller, heavier, lighter, longer, or shorter.

In this section, we will learn some basic skills to start understanding the sizes and lengths of things around us. Let's explore the different ways we can measure together!

1. Using Non-Standard Units

Before we use rulers and tape measures, we can start with non-standard units. Non-standard units are things we can use to measure others, like our hands, feet, or even blocks.

Activity 1: How Many Hands?
Place your hand down on a piece of paper and trace it. Cut out the hand tracing. Now, let's measure the length of your desk with the hand cut-out.

How many hand lengths is your desk?

Example answer: If your hand cut-out is 5 inches long and your desk is 20 inches long, you would have 4 hand lengths because 20 divided by 5 equals 4.

Activity 2: How Many Blocks?
Use building blocks to measure the length of a book.

How many blocks long is the book?

Example answer: If each block is 1 inch long and the book is 10 inches long, you would need 10 blocks to measure the book.

2. Compare Sizes

We can also compare different objects without measuring their exact size, just by looking at them and deciding which one is bigger or smaller, taller or shorter.

Activity 1: Size Sorting
Place these items in order from smallest to largest: a pencil, a shoe, and a school backpack.

Example answer: pencil, shoe, backpack.

Activity 2: Comparing Heights
Look at two plants in your house. Which one is taller? Which one is shorter?

Example answer: Plant A is taller than Plant B.

3. Basic Tools for Measuring

As we grow in our measuring skills, we will start to use tools like rulers and measuring tapes. For now, let's learn what they are.

A ruler is a long, flat tool with numbers on it. It helps us measure how long or wide something is. A measuring tape is like a flexible ruler that can bend around curves and corners.

Activity 1: Exploring a Ruler
Take a 12-inch ruler and measure a bookâ€™s width.

How many inches wide is the book?

Example answer: The book is 8 inches wide.

Activity 2: Measuring Tape Adventure
Use a measuring tape to find the length of your bed.

How many inches long is the bed?

Example answer: The bed is 60 inches long.

Remember, measuring helps us to find out about the world around us. It can be fun to see how big or small things are. Keep practicing your measuring skills with the activities we've done today, and you'll be a measuring expert in no time!

Answers will vary for each student depending on the items they have at home to complete the activities with. The example answers provided assume typical sizes for the objects in the exercises but may not reflect the actual measurements each student will find. Encourage your students to write down their own measurements in the workbook to track their progress.
