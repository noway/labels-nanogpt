# Time and Seasons

## Introduction to Seasons

Hello, little learners! Today we are going to talk about something really special that happens outside all year round. It is all about the **seasons**! Seasons are like four different chapters in a year that bring different kinds of weather and fun activities we can do. Do you know there are four seasons? Let’s discover what they are!

### The Four Seasons

1. **Spring** 
2. **Summer**
3. **Fall** (also called Autumn)
4. **Winter**

Each season lasts about three months, and they happen in a special order. Let’s explore a little about each one!

#### Spring
Spring is when things start to warm up after the chilly winter. Trees get new leaves, flowers start to bloom, and animals come out to play. It’s like the whole world is waking up! 

#### Summer
Next comes summer. It's usually the warmest season. We can go swimming and enjoy long days as the sun stays up longer. Don’t forget to wear your sunscreen!

#### Fall
After summer, it’s time for fall, or autumn. This is when leaves change their colors to beautiful oranges, reds, and yellows before they fall off the trees. The weather starts to cool down, and it's a great time for hayrides and apple picking.

#### Winter
Last is winter. Brrr! It gets cold, and in some places, it snows, covering everything in white. We wear scarves, hats, and gloves to stay warm. It’s a perfect season for building snowmen and sipping hot cocoa!

### Let's Practice!

Now, boys and girls, let's do some fun activities to learn more about the seasons.

#### Activity 1: Match the Season
Draw a line from the season word to the picture that matches it best.
- Spring: A picture of a butterfly and flowers.
- Summer: A picture of a sun and kids swimming.
- Fall: A picture of a pumpkin and leaves.
- Winter: A picture of a snowman and snowflakes.

You did it! Let's check the answers:

- Spring matches with the butterfly and flowers.
- Summer goes with the sun and kids swimming.
- Fall is right with the pumpkin and leaves.
- Winter pairs with the snowman and snowflakes.

#### Activity 2: Season Sorting
Place these items under the correct season they belong to:
- Ice skates
- Sand bucket and shovel
- Colorful leaves
- Umbrella

Here are the answers:

- Ice skates go under Winter.
- Sand bucket and shovel belong to Summer.
- Colorful leaves are in Fall.
- Umbrella is used in Spring, especially on rainy days.

#### Activity 3: Seasonal Activities
Circle the activities you might do in each season.

1. Spring: Plant a flower, Build a snowman, Jump in puddles, Go sledding
2. Summer: Have a picnic, Swim in a pool, Collect fall leaves, Make hot cocoa
3. Fall: Carve a pumpkin, Wear a bathing suit, Rake leaves, Go ice fishing
4. Winter: Go skiing, Have a snowball fight, Fly a kite, Wear shorts

Nice work! Here’s what most of you would have circled:

1. Spring: Plant a flower, Jump in puddles
2. Summer: Have a picnic, Swim in a pool
3. Fall: Carve a pumpkin, Rake leaves
4. Winter: Go skiing, Have a snowball fight

Great job learning about the seasons, everyone! Now, whenever you look outside, think about which season it is and what that means for the weather and the fun things you can do. Keep learning and exploring, and always remember to enjoy the beauty of each season!
