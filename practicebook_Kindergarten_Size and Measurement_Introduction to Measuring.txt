# Size and Measurement

## Introduction to Measuring

Welcome to the exciting world of measuring! In this section, we are going to learn all about different ways to measure things. Measuring can help us find out how long, how tall, or how heavy something is. 

### What is Measuring?

Measuring is a way to find out how big or small an object is using units like inches, feet, centimeters, or meters. But for now, we are going to start with simple tools to measure things, such as paper clips, blocks, or even our own hands and feet!

### Why Do We Measure?

We measure things all the time without even realising it! When we want to see if a shoe fits, we are measuring our foot. When we want to make sure our drawing fits on a sheet of paper, we are measuring the space we have to draw. Measuring helps us understand the world around us and how we interact with it.

### Tools for Measuring

For Kindergarten students, we use non-standard units to begin understanding the concept of measurement. Non-standard units can be anything that is uniform in size. Here are some tools we might use:

1. Paper Clips
2. Cubes or Blocks
3. Hand Spans
4. Footsteps

### Measuring Length

Let's start with length. Length tells us how long something is from one end to the other.

**Activity 1:** Measure your pencil using paper clips.

- Lay the paper clips from one end of the pencil to the other, touching each other without any gaps or overlaps.
- Count how many paper clips long the pencil is.

**Answer:** If the pencil is 7 paper clips long, you just measured the pencil using paper clips as your unit of measure!

### Measuring Height

Next, let's talk about height. Height is how tall something is.

**Activity 2:** Measure a book standing up using blocks.

- Stack the blocks one on top of the other next to the book.
- Count how many blocks high the book is.

**Answer:** If the book is 5 blocks high, you just measured the height of the book using blocks!

### Measuring Width

Width is how wide something is from one side to the other.

**Activity 3:** Measure the width of the table with your hand spans.

- Open your hand wide and place it at one edge of the table.
- Move your hand to the side and put it down again without overlapping.
- Count how many hand spans it takes to get to the other side of the table.

**Answer:** If the table is 4 hand spans wide, you just found out the width of the table with your hand as the measuring tool!

### Learn to Estimate

Estimation is a clever skill where you make a smart guess about the size of something.

**Activity 4:** Look at your shoe and estimate how many cubes long it is.

- Make a guess by looking at the size of your shoe.
- Then measure with cubes to see if your guess is close.

**Answer:** If you guessed that your shoe is 6 cubes long and it turns out to be exactly 6 cubes, great estimating! If not, that's okay! Estimation gets better with practice.

### Review and Practice

Remember, the key to getting better at measuring is to practice. Use the objects around you to measure other things. Try to use the same objects to measure so you get consistent results. 

### Exercises (Already Completed)

Here are some examples of exercises a student might complete in their practice book, along with the answers:

**Exercise 1:** Measure your school book using crayons.
- **Answer:** The school book might be 8 crayons long.

**Exercise 2:** Measure the door with your footsteps.
- **Answer:** The door might be 10 footsteps tall.

**Exercise 3:** Estimate and then measure how many cubes deep your desk drawer is.
- **Answer:** You might estimate 7 cubes and find it is actually 7 cubes deep after measuring.

By practicing these activities and completing these exercises, you will get a better understanding of size and measurement, and why it is such a useful skill in everyday life. Have fun measuring and comparing different things around you, and see how they all size up!
