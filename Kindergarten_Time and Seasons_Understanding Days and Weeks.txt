## Understanding Days and Weeks

### What is a Day?

A day is a period of time that lasts 24 hours. It starts at midnight, when it is very dark outside, and ends the next midnight. Each day is divided into two main parts: day (when the sun is up, and it's light outside) and night (when the sun is down, and it's dark outside). During the day, there is usually time for playing outside, going to school, and having meals. At night, it's time for sleeping and resting.

### What is a Week?

A week is a collection of days. It's like a string of beads where each bead is a day. There are 7 days in one week. The names of the days of the week are:

1. Sunday
2. Monday
3. Tuesday
4. Wednesday
5. Thursday
6. Friday
6. Saturday

### Activities During the Week

Each day of the week, people often do different activities. For example, many children go to school on Monday through Friday, and then they have Saturday and Sunday to rest and play.

### Example Exercise

#### Activity 3: Special Days

Draw a picture of what you like to do on each day of the week!

For example:
- Monday: Draw yourself reading a book (because you might go to the library).
- Tuesday: Draw yourself eating a taco (maybe it's Taco Tuesday at school!).
- Wednesday: Draw yourself at music class.
- Thursday: Draw yourself playing with your pet.
- Friday: Draw a picture of movie night.

Remember, your week might look different, and that's okay!
