## Answers

### Addition Practice

1. \( 23 + 15 = 38 \)

2. \( 37 + 44 = 81 \)

3. \( 18 + 29 = 47 \)

4. \( 52 + 26 = 78 \)

5. \( 41 + 47 = 88 \)

### Subtraction Practice

6. \( 64 - 27 = 37 \)
   
7. \( 55 - 18 = 37 \)

8. \( 90 - 36 = 54 \)

9. \( 73 - 47 = 26 \)

10. \( 81 - 19 = 62 \)

### Word Problems

11. 24 apples + 32 apples = 56 apples. Amy has 56 apples now.

12. 78 stickers - 25 stickers = 53 stickers. Jack has 53 stickers left.

### Telling Time

13. 11:00 A.M. + 30 minutes = 11:30 A.M.
