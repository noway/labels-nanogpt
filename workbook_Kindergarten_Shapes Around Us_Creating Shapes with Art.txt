# Shapes Around Us - Creating Shapes with Art

Kindergarten is a fantastic time to discover and play with shapes. In this section, we are going to explore different shapes by making them using art. Each of these activities will help you to recognize shapes more easily in the world around you, and have fun while doing it!

### Activity 1: Shape Collage

Materials Needed:
- Construction paper or blank drawing paper
- Old magazines or colored paper
- Scissors (use with adult supervision)
- Glue
- Crayons or markers

Instructions:
1. Look through magazines or choose colored paper to find pictures or areas of color.
2. Cut out shapes from the pictures or colored paper. Try to cut out a variety of shapes, such as:
   - Circles
   - Squares
   - Rectangles
   - Triangles
3. Arrange the shapes on your blank paper to make a collage.
4. Once you have them where you want, glue the shapes down to create your artwork.
5. Use markers or crayons to add additional details if you'd like.

**Completed Collage:** You should have a unique piece of art featuring a variety of shapes that you have learned about.

### Activity 2: Sponge Paint Shapes

Materials Needed:
- Sponges (cut into different shapes)
- Tempera paint or washable paint
- Paper plates
- White paper or construction paper

Instructions:
1. Cut sponges into simple shapes: circles, squares, rectangles, and triangles.
2. Pour different colors of paint onto paper plates.
3. Dip a sponge shape into the paint, making sure it's fully covered.
4. Press the sponge onto the white paper to make a print of that shape.
5. Continue to dip different shapes into different colors and make prints on your paper.
6. You can overlap shapes or keep them separate.

**Completed Artwork:** You should have a colorful array of painted shapes that may even form a pattern.

### Activity 3: Shape Faces

Materials Needed:
- Construction paper (different colors)
- Scissors
- Glue
- Markers

Instructions:
1. Choose what kind of shape you would like your face to be (circle, square, triangle, etc.).
2. Cut out that shape in a size large enough to be a face.
3. Now cut out other shapes for the features of the face. For example:
   - Circles or ovals for the eyes
   - Squares or rectangles for the teeth
   - A triangle for the nose
4. Glue your face features onto the large shape to create a face.
5. Use markers to add any details you'd like, such as eyebrows or freckles.

**Completed Face:** You should have a funny or cute face made entirely out of shapes!

### Activity 4: Nature Shapes Hunt

Materials Needed:
- Printer to print out a shape checklist (optional)
- Pencil or crayon
- A bag to collect items (optional)

Instructions:
1. Go for a nature walk with an adult.
2. Look for shapes in nature (e.g., a circular tree trunk cross-section, a triangular pine tree, a square brick on a path).
