# Numbers in Our World

## Counting Objects in Our Surroundings

Welcome, little mathematicians! Today, we will take a journey around us and discover how numbers and counting are a big part of everything we see! So, let's put on our counting caps and get started!

Before we dive into our activities, let's remember the important counting rules:

1. **Start from one**: We begin counting with the number 1.
2. **Count one at a time**: Each object we count should get one number.
3. **Say the numbers in order**: The numbers should be said in the correct order, from 1 to 10.
4. **The last number we say tells us how many**: When we stop counting, the last number we say is the number of objects.
