# Time for Time - Learning about Hours

### Introduction

Hello young learner! Today, we're going to discover the wonderful world of hours. Hours are like building blocks of our day. Just like blocks can build a tower, hours build up the whole day. Knowing about hours helps you understand when it's time to wake up, go to school, play, and sleep. So, let’s start our time adventure!

### What is an Hour?

An hour is a way to measure time. There are 24 hours in a day. We use a clock to tell us what hour it is. There are two types of clocks: analog and digital. An analog clock has hands that move around - a short hand for the hour and a long hand for the minutes. A digital clock shows the time with numbers like this: 1:00 or 7:00.

### Seeing Hours on a Clock

On an analog clock, we see the numbers 1 through 12. Each number stands for an hour. The short hand points to the hour that it is right now. 

Exercise 1: Draw the hour hand pointing at the hour. Here are the times we want to show:

1. 3:00
2. 7:00
3. 9:00
4. 12:00

Answers:

1. The hour hand points directly at the 3.
2. The hour hand points directly at the 7.
3. The hour hand points directly at the 9.
4. The hour hand points directly at the 12, which is at the top.

### Whole Hours and Half Hours

Sometimes we talk about the time as a whole hour like 2:00. Other times we split the hour in half and say it is half past the hour like 2:30. 

Exercise 2: Show what half past the hour looks like for these times on an analog clock face:

1. 2:30 (half past two)
2. 5:30 (half past five)
3. 8:30 (half past eight)
4. 11:30 (half past eleven)

Answers:

1. The hour hand is halfway between the 2 and the 3, and the minute hand is on the 6.
2. The hour hand is halfway between the 5 and the 6, and the minute hand is on the 6.
3. The hour hand is halfway between the 8 and the 9, and the minute hand is on the 6.
4. The hour hand is halfway between the 11 and the 12, and the minute hand is on the 6.

### A Day's Journey in Hours

We experience many hours from the time we wake until we go to bed. Here’s a journey through a day:

- We wake up at 7:00 AM. This is 7 hours after midnight.
- We might go to school at 8:00 AM. That's 1 hour after we wake up.
- We have lunch at 12:00 PM. This is the middle of the day, 12 hours after midnight.
- We play outside at 3:00 PM. This is 3 hours after lunchtime.
- We have dinner at 6:00 PM. This is 6 hours after noon.
- We go to bed at 8:00 PM. That’s 8 hours after lunch.

Exercise 3: Draw a line to match the activity with the time it happens.

1. Wake Up | A. 3:00 PM
2. School | B. 6:00 PM
3. Lunch | C. 8:00 PM
4. Play Outside | D. 12:00 PM
5. Dinner | E. 8:00 AM
6. Bed Time | F. 7:00 AM

Answers:

1. Wake Up - F. 7:00 AM
2. School - E. 8:00 AM
3. Lunch - D. 12:00 PM
4. Play Outside - A. 3:00 PM
5. Dinner - B. 6:00 PM
6. Bed Time - C. 8:00 PM

### AM and PM

One more thing to learn about hours is AM and PM. AM means the time from midnight to noon (the first 12 hours of the day). PM means the time from noon to midnight (the last 12 hours of the day).

### You did it!

Great job learning about hours! Remember, practice makes perfect. Keep looking at clocks throughout the day to get even better at telling time.

Keep learning, and soon, you'll be a time-telling champion!
