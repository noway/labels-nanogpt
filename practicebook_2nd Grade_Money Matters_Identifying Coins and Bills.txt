Welcome to the "Identifying Coins and Bills" section of your math practice book! Money comes in different forms, and in this section, we'll learn about the coins and bills you may encounter in everyday transactions. Let's dive right in and get to know each one.

### Coins

Coins are small, typically round pieces of metal that have different values. In the United States, we use several common coins. Below you will find exercises to help you recognize and understand the value of each coin.

- **Color:** Silver
- **Notable Feature:** George Washington is on one side, and the reverse side usually has different designs, many of which represent the 50 U.S. states.

*Exercise 4*

Count the quarters and write down how much money they are worth in total:

(Answer: Count the number of silver coins with George Washington's face on them and multiply by 25 cents.)

### Bills

Bills are paper money that represents larger amounts of currency. Each bill size has distinctive color and designs to help you identify them.

**Dollar Bill ($1)**

- **Color:** Green and black
- **Notable Feature:** George Washington is on the front, and the Great Seal of the United States is on the back.

*Exercise 5*

Find all the $1 bills and add up their value:

(Answer: Count the number of $1 bills and add them together.)

**Five Dollar Bill ($5)**

- **Color:** Green with touches of purple and gray
- **Notable Feature:** Abraham Lincoln is on the front, and the Lincoln Memorial is on the back.

*Exercise 6*

Multiply the number of $5 bills by 5 to get their total value:

(Answer: Take the number of $5 bills and multiply by 5.)

**Ten Dollar Bill ($10)**

- **Color:** Green and orange
- **Notable Feature:** Alexander Hamilton is on the front, and the U.S. Treasury Building is on the back.

*Exercise 7*

Count the $10 bills and calculate the total value:

(Answer: Count the number of $10 bills and multiply by 10.)

**Practice Activity:**

Now that you’ve learned about American coins and bills, let's put your knowledge to the test. Below is a collection of coins and bills. Write down the value of each, and then calculate the total value.

Coins and Bills:

- 3 Quarters
- 4 Dimes
- 5 Nickels
- 10 Pennies
- 2 One Dollar Bills
- 1 Five Dollar Bill

Calculate the value of each type and the total amount of money:

- Quarters: 3 x $0.25 = $0.75
- Dimes: 4 x $0.10 = $0.40
- Nickels: 5 x $0.05 = $0.25
- Pennies: 10 x $0.01 = $0.10
- One Dollar Bills: 2 x $1.00 = $2.00
- Five Dollar Bill: 1 x $5.00 = $5.00

Total Value:

$0.75 + $0.40 + $0.25 + $0.10 + $2.00 + $5.00 = $8.50

The collection of coins and bills is worth $8.50 in total.

Understanding money and its different denominations is a valuable skill. Keep practicing, and soon, you'll be a pro at identifying coins and bills!
