# Math in Our World

## Applying Math in Daily Life

Math is all around us! It helps us understand and manage our daily life activities. Here's how you can see math in action every day:

### Knowing the Time

**Example:** You have soccer practice at 4:30 PM, and it's 3:50 PM right now. How much time do you have before practice starts?

**Exercise 1:** If it takes you 15 minutes to get ready and 20 minutes to walk to the soccer field, will you be on time for practice?

_Answer:_ You have 40 minutes until practice. Getting ready and walking takes 15 + 20 = 35 minutes. Yes, you will be on time because you have 5 minutes to spare (40 minutes - 35 minutes = 5 minutes).

### Money Management

**Example:** You have 3 dollars, and you want to buy a toy that costs 1 dollar and 50 cents. How much money will you have left after buying the toy?

**Exercise 2:** If you also want to buy a small snack that costs 75 cents, can you afford it with the remaining money?

_Answer:_ After buying the toy, you have 3 dollars - 1 dollar 50 cents = 1 dollar 50 cents. Yes, you can afford the snack because it costs less than 1 dollar 50 cents you have left.

### Cooking and Baking

**Example:** A recipe says you need 4 cups of flour to make cookies. If you want to make half the amount of cookies, how many cups of flour do you need?

**Exercise 3:** If you made 12 cookies with the full recipe, how many cookies will you make with half the amount of flour?

_Answer:_ You need 4 cups / 2 = 2 cups of flour for half the amount of cookies. You will make 12 cookies / 2 = 6 cookies with half.

### Shopping and Discounts

**Example:** A toy costs $10, but it's on sale for 20% off. How much does the toy cost now?

**Exercise 4:** If your mom gives you a $5 coupon for the toy, how much will you pay after the discount and the coupon?

_Answer:_ 20% of $10 is 0.20 x 10 = $2. The toy now costs $10 - $2 = $8. With the $5 coupon, the toy will cost $8 - $5 = $3.

### Comparing and Measuring

**Example:** Your fish tank is 12 inches long and 10 inches wide. What is its perimeter?

**Exercise 5:** If your friend's fish tank is 14 inches long and 9 inches wide, whose fish tank has a larger perimeter?

_Answer:_ Your fish tank's perimeter is 2 x (12 inches + 10 inches) = 44 inches. Your friend's fish tank's perimeter is 2 x (14 inches + 9 inches) = 46 inches. Your friend's fish tank has a larger perimeter.

Math helps you make decisions, save time, and even have fun with your friends and family. Whether you're playing games, planning an outing, or saving money for a special toy, math is your helpful tool every step of the way.

Remember to practice these examples in your daily life, and you'll see how math can be not only useful but also enjoyable!
