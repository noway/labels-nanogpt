# Fun with Measurement: Light and Heavy

Welcome to the exciting world of measurement, little learners! Today, we're going to explore the concept of "Light and Heavy." These are words we use to describe how much something weighs. Things that are not very heavy are called light, and things that are very heavy are called heavy. Let's have some fun figuring out the differences!

## Discovering Light and Heavy

_To begin our adventure, let's do a little experiment. Find two items in your classroom or at home—a pencil and a textbook. Lift each one with your hand. Which one is easier to lift? We can say that the pencil is light, and the textbook is heavy._

### ACTIVITY 1: Sorting Items

Below are some items that you might find around you. Draw a line from each item to the correct box: Light or Heavy.

**Items:**
1. Feather
2. Basketball
3. Apple
4. Toy Car
5. Rock
6. Spoon

**Boxes:**
- Light [ ]
- Heavy [ ]

_Answers:_
- Feather — Light
- Basketball — Light
- Apple — Light
- Toy Car — Light (unless it is a very large toy car)
- Rock — Heavy
- Spoon — Light

Great job sorting! Remember, whether something is light or heavy can change depending on how big or small it is.

### ACTIVITY 2: True or False

Read the statements below and decide if they are true or false. Circle your choice.

1. A leaf is heavier than a car. (True / False)
2. A sandwich is lighter than a refrigerator. (True / False)
3. An empty backpack is lighter than a full one. (True / False)
4. A watermelon is lighter than a grape. (True / False)
5. A bottle of water is heavier when it is full than when it is empty. (True / False)

_Answers:_
1. False
2. True
3. True
4. False
5. True

### ACTIVITY 3: Compare and Contrast

In each row, circle the item that is heavier.

**Row 1:** Cup of Jellybeans [ ] | Cup of Marshmallows [ ]

**Row 2:** Kitten [ ] | Puppy [ ]

**Row 3:** School Bus [ ] | Bicycle [ ]

**Row 4:** Basketball [ ] | Ping Pong Ball [ ]

**Row 5:** Pillow [ ] | Brick [ ]

_Answers:_
**Row 1:** Cup of Jellybeans
**Row 2:** typically a Puppy is heavier.
**Row 3:** School Bus
**Row 4:** Basketball
**Row 5:** Brick

### ACTIVITY 4: Measuring Weight

For this activity, you'll need a scale! Use a scale to weigh some objects around your house or classroom. Write down the weight of each object and then order them from lightest to heaviest.

**Objects:**
1. A bunch of bananas
2. A shoe
3. Your favorite book
4. A water bottle
5. An orange

_Use the lines below to write down the weight of each object and then list them from lightest to heaviest._

_Answers (Example - students will have their unique answers):_
1. An Orange - 0.2 lbs
2. A bunch of bananas - 2.1 lbs
3. A water bottle - 1.0 lbs (empty), 2.5 lbs (full)
4. A shoe - 1.0 lbs
5. Your favorite book - 0.8 lbs

**From Lightest to Heaviest:**
An Orange, Your favorite book, A shoe (ties with water bottle if empty), A water bottle (full), A bunch of bananas

Well done! You've finished the "Light and Heavy" section of the "Fun with Measurement" chapter. You've learned that weight can tell us if something is light or heavy. You have also practiced sorting, comparing, and even measuring different items to see which are light and which are heavy. Keep practicing, and you'll become a measurement master in no time!
