# Chapter 4: Telling Time

**Section 3: Days of the Week and Months of the Year**

Understanding the days of the week and the months of the year is an important part of learning about time. These are the words we use to describe when things happen.

### Days of the Week
There are seven days in a week. They go in this order:

1. Sunday
2. Monday
3. Tuesday
4. Wednesday
5. Thursday
6. Friday
6. Saturday

The days of the week are always in this order. After Saturday, the next day is Sunday again, and a new week starts.

Remember:
- The weekend consists of Saturday and Sunday.
- School and work weeks typically go from Monday to Friday.

### Months of the Year
There are twelve months in a year. They go in this order:

1. January
2. February
3. March
4. April
5. May
6. June
7. July
8. August
9. September
10. October
11. November
12. December

Some months have 30 days, some have 31 days, and February can have 28 or 29 days. When February has 29 days, it is called a leap year, and it happens every 4 years.

Remember:
- The year starts in January and ends in December.
- To remember how many days are in each month, you can use this rhyme: "Thirty days have September, April, June, and November; all the rest have thirty-one, except for February alone, Which has twenty-eight days clear, and twenty-nine in each leap year."
