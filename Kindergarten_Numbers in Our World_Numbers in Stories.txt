**The Tale of the Five Little Ducks**

Once upon a time, there were five little ducks that lived near a beautiful pond. They loved to play, swim, and quack all day long.

One sunny morning, the five little ducks went out to play. They swam in the pond, racing each other from one end to the other. But when it was time to go home, only four little ducks came back.

Mother Duck was worried and called out, “Quack, quack, quack!” But only four little ducks were there to hear her.

The next day, the four little ducks went out to play, splashing and having a great time. But again, when they returned, there were only three little ducks!

Mother Duck, feeling even more worried, quacked louder, “Quack, quack, quack!” But only three little ducks came waddling back.

This went on until there were no little ducks left! Mother Duck was very sad and quacked sadly, “Quack, quack, quack.” But to her surprise, all five little ducks came back! They had been on grand adventures and had many stories to share.

**The Story of Three Busy Bees**

In a bright and sunny flower garden, three busy bees were buzzing along, collecting nectar from the flowers. Bee One visited two yellow flowers, Bee Two visited three purple flowers, and Bee Three visited four red flowers.

**Exercises**

1. **Count Your Flowers**: How many flowers did the three bees visit in total?
   
   - Write down how you add them up: _____ yellow + _____ purple + _____ red = _____ total
   
   ⭐ Answer: Bee One visited 2 yellow flowers, Bee Two visited 3 purple flowers, and Bee Three visited 4 red flowers. That's 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 flowers in total!

2. **More Buzzing**: If each bee visited one more flower, how many flowers would they have visited in total then?
   
   - Write down your new addition: _____ yellow + _____ purple + _____ red = _____ total
   
   ⭐ Answer: If each bee visited one more flower, it would be (2+1) + (3+1) + (4+1) = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 flowers in total!

Remember, numbers in stories can be just like numbers we use every day. They help us learn about how many, how much, how far, and even how fun! Always keep an eye out for those sneaky numbers – they're everywhere in our world!
