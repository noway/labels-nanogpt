# Division Concepts and Facts

## Introduction to Division

Division is one of the four basic operations in mathematics, along with addition, subtraction, and multiplication. It can be thought of as the process of splitting a number into equal parts or groups. Division tells us how many times one number is contained within another number.

## Understanding Division Terms

When we divide, we use specific terms to describe the parts of our division equation:

- **Dividend**: The number that is being divided.
- **Divisor**: The number by which the dividend is divided.
- **Quotient**: The answer to a division problem.
- **Remainder**: The amount left over when the division cannot be done exactly.

For example, in the division problem `20 ÷ 4 = 5`, 20 is the dividend, 4 is the divisor, and 5 is the quotient.

## Division Equations

Let's practice writing division equations. Note that these examples are structured to show how multiplication and division are inverse operations.

_Multiplication Equation_: `3 x 4 = 12`
_Division Equation_: `12 ÷ 3 = 4` or `12 ÷ 4 = 3`

## Dividing By 1 and the Number Itself

Dividing a number by 1 always gives the number itself as the quotient.

_Example_: `7 ÷ 1 = 7`

Dividing a number by itself always gives 1 as the quotient.

_Example_: `9 ÷ 9 = 1`

## Division without Remainders

When a dividend can be divided by the divisor without any leftovers, we say there is no remainder.

_Example_: `28 ÷ 7 = 4` with no remainder.

---
## Division with Remainders

Sometimes division will not result in a whole number. When this happens, the number left over is called the remainder.

_Example_: `29 ÷ 7 = 4 R1`, where 4 is the quotient, and 1 is the remainder.

## Exercises: Division with Remainders

Find the quotients and remainders for the following division problems.

1. `34 ÷ 6 = ____ R____`
2. `55 ÷ 8 = ____ R____`
3. `47 ÷ 5 = ____ R____`
4. `61 ÷ 7 = ____ R____`

2. _6_ R _7_
3. _9_ R _2_
4. _8_ R _5_
5. _8_ R _1_

## Zero as a Divisor

It is important to remember that division by zero is undefined. You cannot divide a number by zero.

_Example_: `7 ÷ 0 = undefined`

## Review Questions

Answer the following questions to review what you've learned.

1. If you divide 30 by 1, what is the quotient?
2. What is the remainder when you divide 15 by 4?
3. Can a number be divided by zero? Explain your answer.

_Answers:_
1. The quotient is _30_, because any number divided by 1 is the number itself.
2. The remainder is _3_ because 15 ÷ 4 equals 3 with a remainder of 3 (4 x 3 = 12, and 15 - 12 = 3).
3. No, a number cannot be divided by zero. Division by zero is undefined because there is no number that you can multiply by zero to get any number other than zero.
