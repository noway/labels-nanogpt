## Definitions of Key Math Terms

### Addition
Addition is a mathematical operation that represents combining collections of objects together into a larger collection. It is signified by the plus sign (+). For example, if you have 3 apples and you get 2 more, you have 3 + 2 apples, which equals 5 apples.

### Answer
An answer is the result of a mathematical operation. For instance, if a problem asks what 4 + 3 is, the answer is 7.

### Array
An array is a way of displaying objects in rows and columns to show a multiplication problem visually. For example, 3 rows of 4 objects each would represent the multiplication fact 3 x 4.

### Associative Property
The Associative Property states that the way in which numbers are grouped in an addition or multiplication problem does not change the result. For example, (2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4).

### Bar Graph
A bar graph is a chart that uses bars to show data visually. Each bar represents a quantity for a particular group or category.

### Commutative Property
The Commutative Property states that you can change the order of the numbers in an addition or multiplication problem, and the result will be the same. For example, 4 + 5 = 5 + 4.

### Decimal
A decimal is a way to represent fractions using place value in tenths, hundredths, etc. For example, 0.5 is a decimal that equals 5/10 or ½.

### Difference
The difference is the result of a subtraction problem. For example, the difference between 8 and 3 is 5.

### Dividend
The dividend is the number that is being divided in a division problem. For instance, in 15 ÷ 3, the number 15 is the dividend.

### Divisor
The divisor is the number by which the dividend is being divided in a division problem. In 15 ÷ 3, the number 3 is the divisor.

### Equation
An equation is a mathematical statement that uses the equals sign to show that two expressions are equal. For example, 7 + 3 = 10.

### Even Numbers
Even numbers are whole numbers that can be divided evenly by 2. Examples of even numbers include 2, 4, 6, and 8.

### Expanded Form
Expanded form is a way of writing numbers to show the value of each digit. For example, 345 can be written in expanded form as 300 + 40 + 5.

### Factor
A factor is a number that divides into another number exactly, without leaving a remainder. For example, the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.

### Fraction
A fraction is a way to describe a part of a whole or a part of a group by using two numbers, the numerator and the denominator. For example, in the fraction ½, 1 is the numerator and 2 is the denominator.

### Graph
A graph is a visual way to represent data or mathematical relationships. It can include bar graphs, line graphs, and pie charts, among others.

### Line Plot
A line plot is a graph that shows frequency of data along a number line. It is useful for showing the distribution of data points.

### Multiplication
Multiplication is a mathematical operation that is essentially repeated addition of the same number. For example, 4 x 3 means adding 4 three times (4 + 4 + 4), which equals 12.

### Number Line
A number line is a straight line with numbers placed at equal intervals along its length. It is often used to illustrate addition and subtraction.

### Odd Numbers
Odd numbers are whole numbers that cannot be divided evenly by 2. Examples of odd numbers include 1, 3, 5, and 7.

### Perimeter
Perimeter is the total distance around the edges of a two-dimensional shape. For example, if a square has sides of length 4, its perimeter would be 4 + 4 + 4 + 4, which is 16.

### Place Value
Place value is the value of where the digit is in the number. For example, in the number 543, the place value of 4 is 40, because it is in the tens place.

### Product
The product is the result of multiplying two or more numbers together. For instance, the product of 3 and 4 is 12.

### Quotient
The quotient is the result of a division problem. For example, the quotient of 10 divided by 2 is 5.

### Rounding
Rounding is a process of approximating a number to make it simpler or to fit within certain limits. For example, 82 rounded to the nearest ten is 80.

### Subtraction
Subtraction is a mathematical operation where you take one number away from another. For example, if you have 5 apples and eat 2, you subtract 2 from 5, leaving you with 3 apples.

### Sum
The sum is the result of adding two or more numbers together. For example, the sum of 4 and 3 is 7.
