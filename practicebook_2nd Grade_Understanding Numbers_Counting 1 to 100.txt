# Understanding Numbers

## Chapter: Counting 1 to 100

### Welcome Second Graders!

Working with numbers is a big part of second grade. In this section, we're going to practice counting from 1 to 100. This is an important skill that will help you understand how numbers work and how they fit together. Let's embark on this exciting numerical journey!

### Getting Started

Before we begin counting, remember that we count numbers in a specific order. This order helps us keep track of where we are and what comes next.

Let's warm up by counting from 1 to 10 together:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

Great job! Now that we've warmed up, it's time to stretch our counting muscles even more.

### Counting from 1 to 100

The secret to counting to 100 is to understand patterns. Once you know the pattern for the tens (10, 20, 30, and so on), it becomes much easier!

#### Exercise 1: Finish the Pattern

Fill in the missing numbers to complete the pattern from 1 to 20.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,  
11, __, 13, __, 15, __, 17, __, 19, 20

**Answers:**
12, 14, 16, 18

Good job! You finished the pattern. Did you notice that the second digit is what changes each time? Now let's keep the counting going!

#### Exercise 2: Count by Tens

Next, we're going to practice counting by tens. Can you write down the numbers that come next?

10, 20, 30, 40, __, __, __, __, 90, 100

**Answers:**
50, 60, 70, 80

That's the way! You’re getting the hang of the pattern. Every time we start a new set of tens, the last digit starts over at zero.

#### Exercise 3: Fill in the Blank Spaces

We've written down numbers from 1 to 100, but some are missing! Fill in the blanks.

21, 22, 23, 24, 25, __, 27, __, __, 30  
31, __, 33, __, 35, 36, __, 38, 39, __  
41, 42, __, 44, 45, __, 47, 48, __, 50  
__, 52, 53, __, 55, 56, __, 58, 59, 60  
61, __, 63, 64, __, 66, 67, __, __, 70  
71, 72, __, __, 75, __, 77, 78, __, 80  
81, 82, __, 84, __, 86, 87, __, 89, __  
__, 92, 93, 94, __, 96, 97, __, 99, 100

**Answers:**

26, 28, 29,  
32, 34, 37, 40,  
43, 46, 49,  
51, 54, 57,  
62, 65, 68, 69,  
73, 74, 76, 79,  
83, 85, 88, 90,  
91, 95, 98

Fantastic job completing the sequence! Counting all the way up to 100 might seem like a lot, but when you recognize the patterns, it gets much easier.

#### Exercise 4: Practice Makes Perfect

Finally, let’s practice by writing down the whole sequence from 1 to 100, but this time let’s skip a few lines to make it more challenging!

1-10: __, 2, __, 4, __, 6, __, 8, __, 10  
11-20: __, 12, __, 14, __, 16, __, 18, __, 20  
21-30: __, __, 23, __, 25, __, 27, __, 29, __  
...  
91-100: __, __, 93, __, 95, __, 97, __, 99, __

**Answers:**

1, 3, 5, 7, 9  
11, 13, 15, 17, 19  
21, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30  
...  
91, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100

Well done! You've practiced counting from 1 to 100, and you've gotten better at recognizing patterns and sequences of numbers.

This practice will help you in many areas of math, like addition, subtraction, and even multiplication and division later on. Keep practicing, and you'll be a number expert in no time!

Remember, practice is key! So keep counting, and try counting in other fun ways too - like backwards, by twos, fives, or any other pattern you like!
