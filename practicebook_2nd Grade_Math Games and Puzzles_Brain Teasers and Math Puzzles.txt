## Puzzle 1: The Fruit Basket

Tom has a basket full of apples and oranges. There are 10 fruits in the basket. If there are 4 apples, how many oranges are there?

### Solution
There are 6 oranges. If there are 4 apples, and there are 10 fruits in total, you subtract the number of apples from the total number of fruits to find the number of oranges: 10 - 4 = 6.

## Puzzle 2: The Magic Number

What is the magic number? It is greater than 20 but less than 30, it is even, and when you add the two digits together, you get 8.

### Solution
The magic number is 26. It is the only number between 20 and 30 that is even (22, 24, 26, 28) and has digits that add up to 8 (2 + 6 = 8).

## Puzzle 3: The Secret Code

Each letter represents a number. If A = 1, B = 2, and C = 3, what numbers do the letters in the word "CAT" represent?

### Solution
C = 3, A = 1, T = 20. So, the word "CAT" represents the numbers 3, 1, 20.

## Puzzle 4: The Missing Number

What is the missing number in the sequence: 3, 6, ?, 12, 15

### Solution
The missing number is 9. The sequence is increasing by 3 each time: 3 + 3 = 6, 6 + 3 = 9, 9 + 3 = 12, 12 + 3 = 15.

## Puzzle 5: The Odd One Out

Which number does not belong in the following series? 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12

### Solution
The number 7 does not belong. All other numbers are even, while 7 is odd.

## Puzzle 6: The Cookie Jar

If there are 3 cookies in a jar and you take out 2 cookies, how many cookies do you have?

### Solution
You have 2 cookies. The question asks how many cookies you have taken out, not how many are left in the jar.

## Puzzle 7: The Pattern Finder

What comes next in the pattern: Triangle, Circle, Triangle, Circle, Triangle, ?

### Solution
The next shape is a Circle. The pattern is a triangle followed by a circle, and it repeats.

## Puzzle 8: The Age Puzzle

Ella is twice as old as Julia. Three years ago, she was three times as old. How old is Ella now?

### Solution
Ella is currently 6 years old. Let Julia's age be x. Three years ago, Ella was 3x and Julia was x - 3. Now, Ella is twice as old as Julia: 2x = Ella’s age. Three years ago, 3(x - 3) had to equal Ella's current age minus 3. Solving for x gives Julia's current age as 3, so Ella, who is twice as old, is 6.

## Puzzle 9: The Sharing Cake

Alex has 12 pieces of cake and wants to share them with 3 friends so that each of them gets the same amount. How many pieces of cake does each friend get?

### Solution
Each friend gets 4 pieces of cake. If you divide the 12 pieces by the 3 friends, 12 ÷ 3 = 4.

## Puzzle 10: The Time Puzzle

What is the shortest amount of time — minutes and seconds — it takes for the minute and hour hand of a clock to overlap exactly?

### Solution
The shortest amount of time for the minute and hour hands to overlap exactly is 65 minutes. This occurs when the clock goes from 12:00 to just past 1:05.
