# Shapes and Sizes

## Size Comparison

Welcome to the Size Comparison section of your Math Practice book! In this section, you will learn how to compare different shapes and determine which is bigger, smaller, or if they are the same size.

Before we begin, make sure you have your pencil and eraser ready. You might also want a ruler to help you compare some of the shapes.

### Exercise 1: Comparing Heights

Look at the shapes below. Circle the shape that is the tallest.

1. 📏🏢🏠

    You circled: 🏢 (Shape 2)

    Correct Answer: 🏢 (Shape 2) is the tallest among the shapes.

2. 🌲🌳🌱

    You circled: 🌳 (Shape 2)

    Correct Answer: 🌳 (Shape 2) is the tallest among the shapes.

### Exercise 2: Comparing Widths

Look at the shapes below. Circle the shape that is the widest.

1. 🚗🚌🚜

    You circled: 🚌 (Shape 2)

    Correct Answer: 🚌 (Shape 2) is the widest among the shapes.

2. 🏡🏘️🏰

    You circled: 🏰 (Shape 3)
   
    Correct Answer: 🏰 (Shape 3) is the widest among the shapes.

### Exercise 3: Same or Different Size

Look at the pair of shapes below. Circle "Same" if the shapes are the same size. Circle "Different" if they are not the same size.

1. 🍎🍎
    Same / Different

    You circled: Same

    Correct Answer: Same, both apples are the same size.

2. 🚲🛴
    Same / Different

    You circled: Different

    Correct Answer: Different, the bicycle (Shape 1) is bigger than the scooter (Shape 2).

### Exercise 4: Circle the Smallest

Look at the group of shapes below. Circle the shape that is the smallest.

1. 🐘🐈🐁

    You circled: 🐁 (Shape 3)

    Correct Answer: 🐁 (Shape 3) is the smallest among the shapes.

2. 🌵🌴🌾

    You circled: 🌾 (Shape 3)

    Correct Answer: 🌾 (Shape 3) is the smallest among the plants.

Congratulations! You have completed the Size Comparison section. Remember to practice these exercises, so you become a pro at comparing different shapes and sizes. The more you practice, the better you'll get at observing the world around you and understanding the concept of size. Keep up the great work!
