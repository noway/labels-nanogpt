## Understanding Fractions

### What Is a Fraction?

A fraction represents a part of a whole. It's like cutting a cake into equal pieces. When you take one piece, you take a fraction of the entire cake. Fractions are written with two numbers separated by a line. The number above the line is called the numerator, and the number below is the called denominator.

**Numerator (Top number):** Tells us how many parts we have.  
**Denominator (Bottom number):** Tells us into how many equal parts the whole is divided.

### Types of Fractions

- **Proper Fractions:** The numerator is smaller than the denominator, like 1/2 or 3/4.
- **Improper Fractions:** The numerator is equal to or larger than the denominator, like 4/4 or 5/3.
- **Mixed Numbers:** A whole number and a proper fraction combined, like 1 1/2 or 2 3/4.

### Visualizing Fractions

Imagine a pizza sliced into 8 equal pieces. Each piece is a fraction of the pizza. If you take 3 slices, you have 3 out of 8 pieces, so we write it as 3/8.

### Fraction of a Set

Fractions can also be used to describe a set of things. For example, if you have 10 apples and you give away 3 apples, the fraction of apples you gave away is 3/10.

### Equivalence

Two fractions are equivalent if they represent the same part of a whole, even if they look different. For example, 2/4 is equivalent to 1/2 because they both represent half of something.

To make equivalent fractions, you can multiply or divide the numerator and the denominator by the same number (except zero).

### Comparing Fractions

When fractions have the same denominator, itâ€™s easy to compare them. The one with the bigger numerator is larger. With different denominators, we can find a common denominator or convert them to decimals to compare.

### Exercises

1. **Identify Fractions**  
Draw a circle and divide it into 4 equal parts. Color in 1 part. What fraction of the circle is colored?  
**Answer:** 1/4 of the circle is colored.

2. **Equivalent Fractions**  
Find a fraction equivalent to 1/2 by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 3.  
**Answer:** 3/6 is equivalent to 1/2. (1x3)/(2x3) = 3/6.

3. **Comparing Fractions**  
Which is bigger: 3/8 or 2/8?  
**Answer:** 3/8 is bigger than 2/8.

4. **Fraction of a Set**  
There are 12 crayons in a box. If 4 crayons are blue, what fraction of the crayons are blue?  
**Answer:** 4/12 (or 1/3 if simplified).

5. **Mixed Numbers**  
Write the mixed number for 9/4.  
**Answer:** 2 1/4.

6. **Improper Fractions**  
Convert the mixed number 2 1/4 to an improper fraction.  
**Answer:** 9/4.

### Remember

- Every fraction has two parts: a numerator and a denominator.
- The denominator can never be zero.
- Fractions are another way to show division. For instance, 1/4 means 1 divided by 4.
- You can practice fractions by dividing objects around you into equal parts.

Now that you understand the basics of fractions, keep practicing with these exercises and try creating your own problems to test your knowledge!
