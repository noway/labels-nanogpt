# Adding Numbers up to 10

Welcome to "Addition Adventures"! As we embark on this exciting journey, you'll discover how to add numbers together to make new ones. We're going to practice adding numbers all the way up to 10. Remember, when we add, we're putting groups of things together to find out how many we have in total.

Let’s start our adventure with some number adding exercises. 

Exercise 1: Basic Addition

Practice these addition problems. Draw circles to help you count if you need to!

1. 2 + 1 = 3
2. 4 + 3 = 7
3. 5 + 2 = 7
4. 1 + 6 = 7
5. 3 + 4 = 7
6. 1 + 1 = 2
7. 2 + 5 = 7
8. 6 + 1 = 7
9. 2 + 3 = 5
10. 0 + 7 = 7

Nice work! Did you notice that some of the answers were the same? That is okay because different pairs of numbers can add up to the same total.

Exercise 2: Fill in the Blanks

Now, let's see if you can find the missing number in these addition problems. You can use your fingers to count up!

1. 1 + __ = 2
   - Answer: 1

2. 3 + __ = 5
   - Answer: 2

3. 2 + __ = 4

    - Answer: 9

Fantastic! You're getting better at finding out how much more you need to reach a total.

Exercise 3: Word Problems

Now let’s try some word problems to see addition in action!

1. Emma has 3 apples. Her mom gives her 4 more apples. How many apples does Emma have now?
   - 3 apples + 4 apples = 7 apples

2. Ryan has 5 toy cars. His best friend gives him 2 more toy cars. How many toy cars does Ryan have in total?
   - 5 toy cars + 2 toy cars = 7 toy cars

3. There are 6 ducks in the pond. 3 more ducks join them. How many ducks are there in the pond now?
   - 6 ducks + 3 ducks = 9 ducks

4. Grace has 2 candy bars. She finds 3 more candy bars in her bag. How many candy bars does Grace have altogether?
   - 2 candy bars + 3 candy bars = 5 candy bars

5. Ben has 1 ball. His sister gives him another ball. How many balls does Ben have now?
   - 1 ball + 1 ball = 2 balls
