# Introduction to Numbers: Comparing and Ordering Numbers

Welcome, young mathematicians, to the exciting world of numbers! In this section, we will learn about comparing and ordering numbers. This means we'll practice figuring out which numbers are bigger or smaller and how to arrange them in order. Ready to start? Great! Let's dive in.

## Comparing Numbers

When we compare two numbers, we look at them to decide which one is greater (bigger), which one is less (smaller), or if they are equal (the same size). Remember, the number that has more digits is usually greater. For example, 123 is greater than 12. But what if the numbers have the same number of digits? Then we compare them digit by digit, starting from the left.

### Symbols for Comparing Numbers:
- `>` means greater than (the open side of the symbol faces the bigger number)
- `<` means less than (the open side of the symbol faces the smaller number)
- `=` means equal to

**Exercise 1:**
Write the correct symbol (`<`, `>`, or `=`) in the blank:

1. 52 ___ 25
2. 76 ___ 76
3. 89 ___ 98
4. 45 ___ 54
5. 103 ___ 130
6. 242 ___ 224

**Answers:**
1. 52 > 25
2. 76 = 76
3. 89 < 98
4. 45 < 54
5. 103 < 130
6. 242 > 224

Good job on comparing numbers! Now let's learn how to order numbers.

## Ordering Numbers

When you order numbers, you arrange them from the smallest to the largest (ascending order) or from the largest to the smallest (descending order). To do this accurately, you might have to compare numbers. Let's get some practice!

**Exercise 2:**
Write these numbers in ascending order (from smallest to biggest):

1. 57, 75, 27, 72
2. 164, 146, 416, 461
3. 333, 313, 331, 133

**Answers:**
1. 27, 57, 72, 75
2. 146, 164, 416, 461
3. 133, 313, 331, 333

**Exercise 3:**
Now, write the same sets of numbers in descending order (from biggest to smallest):

1. 57, 75, 27, 72
2. 164, 146, 416, 461
3. 333, 313, 331, 133

**Answers:**
1. 75, 72, 57, 27
2. 461, 416, 164, 146
3. 333, 331, 313, 133

Excellent work! Remember, when ordering numbers, always start by comparing the largest place value and continue comparing to the right until you find a difference.

## Fun Tip:

You can think of the "greater than" (>) and "less than" (<) symbols as a little mouth that wants to eat the bigger number! This fun trick can help you remember which way the symbols should face.
