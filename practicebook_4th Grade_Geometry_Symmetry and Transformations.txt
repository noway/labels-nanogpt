## Geometry: Symmetry and Transformations

In this section, we'll learn about the beauty of symmetry and transformations that you see in objects around us or in patterns. So let's get started!

### Symmetry

Symmetry is when one part of an object is a mirror image of the other part. When an object can be folded or divided into half, and both halves match perfectly, the object is said to be symmetrical.

#### Line of Symmetry

The line of symmetry is the imaginary line where you could fold the image and have both halves match exactly.

**Exercise 1:** Draw the line of symmetry on the following shapes.

a. Square
b. Rectangle
c. Circle
d. Triangle (isosceles)

**Answers:**

a. The square has 4 lines of symmetry, each passing through the midpoints of opposite sides or through opposite corners.
b. The rectangle has 2 lines of symmetry, each passing through the midpoints of opposite sides.
c. The circle has infinite lines of symmetry passing through the center.
d. The isosceles triangle has 1 line of symmetry, passing through the vertex perpendicular to the base.

#### Types of Symmetry 

1. Reflective Symmetry: When two halves are exact reflections of each other.
2. Rotational Symmetry: When an object can be rotated around a central point and still look the same.

**Exercise 2:** Identify the type of symmetry each shape has.

a. Star
b. Equilateral triangle
c. Butterfly wings
d. Regular Pentagon

**Answers:**

a. The star has both reflective and rotational symmetry.
b. Equilateral triangle has rotational symmetry (120 degrees) and 3 lines of reflective symmetry.
c. Butterfly wings often have reflective symmetry.
d. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry (72 degrees) and 5 lines of reflective symmetry.

### Transformations

A transformation changes the position or size of a shape. The main types of transformations are translation, rotation, reflection, and dilation.

#### Translation

A translation moves every point of a figure the same distance in the same direction.

**Exercise 3:** Draw the translation of a rectangle 3 units right and 2 units down.

**Answer:**

The translated rectangle should be shifted to the right by 3 grids and downward by 2 grids without changing its orientation or size.

#### Rotation

A rotation turns a figure around a fixed point called the center of rotation.

**Exercise 4:** Rotate the triangle 90 degrees clockwise around the central point.

**Answer:**

The triangle’s vertices after rotation should be at positions that correspond to a 90-degree clockwise turn around the central point. The top of the triangle will now be facing the right.

#### Reflection

A reflection is a flip over a line. Each point of the image is the same distance from the line of reflection as the original object.

**Exercise 5:** Reflect the given triangle over the y-axis.

**Answer:**

The triangle will appear as a mirror image across the y-axis, with vertices positioned at the same distance from the y-axis but on the opposite side.

#### Dilation

Dilation is resizing a figure without changing its shape. The figure either becomes larger or smaller.

**Exercise 6:** Dilate the square by a scale factor of 2.

**Answer:**

The square’s new side lengths should be twice the size of the original, maintaining the square’s shape but appearing larger.

### Practice Problems:

1. Draw all lines of symmetry for an uppercase letter "H."
2. Identify the type of symmetry present in an arrowhead.
3. Translate the hexagon 4 units up.
4. Rotate the letter "L" 180 degrees counterclockwise.
5. Reflect the shape of a heart over the x-axis.
6. Dilate the given octagon with a scale factor of 1/2.

**Answers:**

1. The uppercase letter "H" has 2 lines of symmetry, one horizontal and one vertical down the middle.
2. An arrowhead typically has reflective symmetry.
3. The translated hexagon should be shifted 4 units upwards.
4. The letter "L" when rotated 180 degrees counterclockwise will look like a backward "L."
5. Reflecting the heart shape over the x-axis will produce an upside-down heart shape.
6. The new octagon will be half the size of the original octagon in each dimension.
