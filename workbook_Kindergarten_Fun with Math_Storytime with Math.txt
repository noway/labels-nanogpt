**The Picnic Party**

Once upon a time, in a green, sunny park, five friends decided to have a wonderful picnic. They had one big picnic blanket, two baskets of food, and a bunch of balloons.

**Exercise 1:** How many friends went to the picnic?

- **Answer:** 5 friends

Each friend brought their favorite fruit. They had two apples, three bananas, one orange, and two bunches of grapes.

**Exercise 2:** How many pieces of fruit did they have in total?

- **Answer:** 2 apples + 3 bananas + 1 orange + 2 bunches of grapes = 8 pieces of fruit

The wind started blowing, and one of the balloons escaped and flew far away into the sky.

**Exercise 3:** If they had eight balloons before, how many balloons do they have now?

- **Answer:** 8 balloons - 1 balloon = 7 balloons


**The Ten Teddy Bear Friends**

Ten teddy bear friends were having a dance party. During the party, some teddy bears got tired and decided to take a nap. Three teddy bears curled up in a cozy bed and fell asleep.

**Exercise 4:** How many teddy bears are still dancing if three went to take a nap?

- **Answer:** 10 teddy bears - 3 teddy bears = 7 teddy bears dancing

After a while, two more teddy bears decided to join those napping.

**Exercise 5:** How many teddy bears are dancing now?

- **Answer:** 7 teddy bears dancing - 2 teddy bears = 5 teddy bears dancing

In the end, all the teddy bears were too sleepy to dance and went to bed.

**Exercise 6:** If there were five teddy bears left dancing and they all joined the others in bed, how many teddy bears are napping in total?

- **Answer:** 3 teddy bears + 2 teddy bears + 5 teddy bears = 10 teddy bears napping


**The Colorful Garden**

In a magical garden, there were four beautiful red roses, three cheerful yellow daffodils, and two lovely purple tulips.

**Exercise 7:** How many flowers were there in the garden?

- **Answer:** 4 red roses + 3 yellow daffodils + 2 purple tulips = 9 flowers

A gardener came and planted two more yellow daffodils to make the garden even brighter.

**Exercise 8:** How many yellow daffodils are there now?

- **Answer:** 3 yellow daffodils + 2 new yellow daffodils = 5 yellow daffodils

After planting the new flowers, the gardener counted all the yellow daffodils to make sure they were all there.

**Exercise 9:** Can you help the gardener count the yellow daffodils again?

- **Answer:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 yellow daffodils
