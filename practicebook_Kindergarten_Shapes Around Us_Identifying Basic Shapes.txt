# Shapes Around Us

## Identifying Basic Shapes

Welcome to the world of shapes! Look around, and you'll see shapes everywhere. From the wheels on a bus to the slice of pizza you had for lunch, shapes are all around us. Let's learn more about them and practice identifying basic shapes in our environment. This will help you to recognize and name the most common shapes you see every day.

### What Are Shapes?

Shapes are the forms of objects. When we look at something, we don't just see what it is; we also see its outline or form - that's the shape! Shapes can be found in everything we see and can be classified into different types, like circles, squares, triangles, and rectangles. Now let's take a closer look at each shape.

### Circle

A circle is round and has no corners or edges. Think of a coin or a button. A circle is the same width all the way around, making it the perfect round shape.

Exercise:
1. Find something round in your classroom and draw it here.

*Example Answer: A student might draw a clock or a coin.*

---

### Square

A square has four equal sides and four corners, which are called angles. Each angle in a square is a right angle. Think of a cracker or a tile.

Exercise:
1. Find something shaped like a square around you and draw it.

*Example Answer: A student might draw a picture of a window or a napkin.*

---

### Triangle

A triangle has three sides and three angles. There are different types of triangles, but for now, just remember that if it has three straight sides, it's a triangle! Think of a slice of pizza or the roof of a house.

Exercise:
1. Look for something that has a triangle shape and draw it.

*Example Answer: A student might draw a picture of a yield traffic sign or a slice of pie.*

---

### Rectangle

A rectangle is similar to a square as it has four sides and four angles. However, the sides are not equal as in a square. A rectangle has two longer sides and two shorter sides. Think of a door or a book.

Exercise:
1. Find a rectangular object and draw it here.

*Example Answer: A student might draw a picture of a computer screen or a notebook.*
