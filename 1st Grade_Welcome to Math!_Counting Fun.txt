## Welcome to Math! 

### Chapter 1: Counting Fun

Hello, boys and girls! Are you ready to have some counting fun with math? Let's dive into the exciting world of numbers! Counting is how we find out the number of things in a group. It sounds just like a fun game, and you will become fantastic at it with a little practice. Let's start counting from 1 to 10 together!

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

Great job! Now, let's make it a bit more fun. Do you see those apples over there? Let's count them!

### Counting Groups

Sometimes, we have more than one group of things to count. This is how we can do it:

**Step 1:** Count the items in each group.
**Step 2:** Add the numbers together to find the total count.

**Exercise 4:** There are two groups of pencils. Count each group, then add them together.

Group 1: ✏️✏️✏️✏️
Group 2: ✏️✏️

**Answer:** ▢

**Answer for Exercise 4:** First, we have 4 pencils in group 1 and 2 pencils in group 2. To find out how many pencils we have in total, we add 4 and 2, which gives us 6. So, the answer is 6 pencils in total!

### Count and Color

**Exercise 5:** Count how many squares and how many circles there are. Then color them! Color the squares blue and the circles red.

**Answers for Exercise 5:**
- Number of squares: 2 (Color them blue.)
- Number of circles: 4 (Color them red.)

### Counting with Addition

Now, we are going to learn a simple part of math called addition. It's when we add one number to another to see what they make together!

**Example:** 2 + 3 = ▢

To find the answer:
1. Start at 2.
2. Count up 3 more (3, 4, 5).
3. The answer is 5!
