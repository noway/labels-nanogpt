# Shapes and Sizes: Shape Patterns

## Introduction to Shape Patterns

Hello young learner! Welcome to the fun world of shapes! In this section, we will learn about shape patterns. A pattern is something that repeats in a certain order. Everything follows a pattern. For example, day follows night, and after that, another day comes. Similarly, shapes can make patterns too.

When we talk about shape patterns, we are looking at a series of shapes that are arranged in a certain order that repeats. Let's learn to recognize, describe, and extend these patterns!

## Recognizing Shape Patterns

### Activity 1: What Comes Next?

Look at the following sequences of shapes and draw the shape that comes next.

1. Circle, square, circle, square, ____
2. Triangle, triangle, circle, triangle, triangle, circle, ____
3. Rectangle, rectangle, square, square, rectangle, rectangle, ____
4. Hexagon, pentagon, hexagon, pentagon, hexagon, ____

#### Answers to Activity 1:

1. Circle
2. Triangle
3. Square
4. Pentagon

### Activity 2: What's the Pattern?

Can you tell what the pattern is in each sequence? Then add two more shapes to continue the pattern.

1. Square, circle, square, circle, square, ____, ____
2. Triangle, rectangle, triangle, rectangle, triangle, ____, ____
3. Hexagon, hexagon, circle, hexagon, hexagon, circle, ____, ____
4. Pentagon, triangle, pentagon, triangle, pentagon, ____, ____

#### Answers to Activity 2:

1. Circle, square
2. Rectangle, triangle
3. Hexagon, circle
4. Triangle, pentagon

## Describing Shape Patterns

Patterns can get trickier! Some patterns increase or decrease in size or change in color. Let's learn how to describe such patterns.

### Activity 3: Describe the Pattern

Tell us what the pattern is doing in each sequence below.

1. Small circle, big circle, small circle, big circle, ____
2. Blue square, blue square, red square, blue square, blue square, red square, ____
3. Big triangle, medium triangle, small triangle, big triangle, medium triangle, ____

#### Answers to Activity 3:

1. Alternating between a small and a big circle.
2. Two blue squares followed by a red square.
3. Decreasing in size from big to medium to small, then repeating.

## Extending Shape Patterns

Now let's see if you can extend the patterns on your own!

### Activity 4: Stretch the Pattern

Draw the next three shapes in each series.

1. Circle, square, square, circle, square, square, ____, ____, ____
2. Small triangle, small triangle, big triangle, small triangle, small triangle, ____, ____, ____
3. Red hexagon, blue hexagon, red hexagon, blue hexagon, red hexagon, ____, ____, ____

#### Answers to Activity 4:

1. Circle, square, square
2. Big triangle, small triangle, small triangle
3. Blue hexagon, red hexagon, blue hexagon

## Practice What You've Learned

Here are a few more patterns for you to try. Write what comes next or continue the pattern as instructed. Good luck, and have fun with patterns!

1. Pentagon, hexagon, pentagon, hexagon, ____ (What comes next?)
2. Blue rectangle, red rectangle, blue rectangle, red rectangle, blue rectangle, ____ (What comes next?)
3. Circle, circle, square, square, square, circle, circle, ____, ____, ____ (Continue the pattern.)

#### Answers for Practice:

1. Pentagon
2. Red rectangle
3. Square, square, square

Excellent job! Patterns are everywhere, and you're becoming wonderful at spotting and continuing them. Keep practicing, and soon you'll be a pattern master!

Remember, patterns have rules. If you can figure out the rule, you can figure out the pattern. Have fun finding patterns in the classroom, your home, or even outside. Shapes are all around you!
