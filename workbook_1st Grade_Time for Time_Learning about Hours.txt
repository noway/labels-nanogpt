**Learning about Hours**

Welcome, Time Explorers! Today we are going to learn about hours and how we use them to tell time. Hours are like building blocks of our day, and understanding them will help you know when it's time for school, play, or bed!

**What is an Hour?**

An hour is a unit of time. Just like there are 12 inches in a foot, there are 60 minutes in an hour. When we say it's "1 o'clock," we mean one hour has passed since it was 12 o'clock. 

**The Clock**

A clock is a tool we use to keep track of time. It has a face with numbers 1 through 12 on it. There are three hands: the hour hand, the minute hand, and sometimes the second hand. We're focusing on the hour hand today, which is shorter and moves slower than the minute hand.

**Exercise 1: Identifying the Hour**

Look at the clocks below. Write down what hour the clock is showing.

1. The hour hand is pointing to the 3. It's 3 o'clock!
2. The hour hand is pointing to the 7. It's 7 o'clock!
3. The hour hand is pointing right between the 11 and the 12. It's 11 o'clock!
4. The hour hand is pointing to the 5. It's 5 o'clock!

**Exercise 2: Drawing the Hour Hand**

The clock shows it's 12 o'clock - draw the hour hand pointing to the 12.

Now, let's say it is 2 o'clock. Can you draw the hour hand pointing to the 2? Great job!

**Exercise 3: AM and PM**

One more thing! Time can be confusing because it repeats itself. We have AM and PM to help us know if it is morning or night. AM stands for “ante meridiem” which is Latin for "before midday." PM stands for “post meridiem” which means "after midday." So, 8:00 AM is in the morning and 8:00 PM is in the evening.

Answer the questions below.

1. When do you eat breakfast, AM or PM?
   - Answer: AM.
   
2. When do you have dinner, AM or PM?
   - Answer: PM.
   
3. Do you go to school in the AM or PM?
   - Answer: AM.

4. Do you usually sleep in the AM, PM, or both?
   - Answer: Both (You usually go to sleep in the PM and wake up in the AM).

**Exercise 4: My Daily Hours**

Think about your day and fill in the blank space with AM or PM for each activity.

1. I wake up at 7:____
   - Answer: AM.

2. I eat lunch at 12:____
   - Answer: PM.

3. I have playtime at 3:____
   - Answer: PM.

4. I go to bed at 8:____
   - Answer: PM.

Remember, Time Explorers, knowing about hours helps us plan our day and do all our activities at the right time. Keep practicing, and soon you'll be a time-telling expert! Keep your eyes on the hour hand, and you'll always know which hour you are in! Keep up the good work!
