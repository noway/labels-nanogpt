**Chapter 4: Fun with Shapes**

**Introduction to 3D Shapes**

Hello, young mathematicians!

So far in this workbook, we've had a great time exploring all kinds of flat shapes, like squares, circles, and triangles, which you can draw on paper. These are called **2D shapes** because they have two dimensions – length and width. Today, we will start a thrilling new adventure into the world of **3D shapes**! 

"But what does 3D mean?" you may ask. 3D stands for three-dimensional. That means, in addition to length and width, 3D shapes have a third dimension – height or depth. It's like adding a superpower to our flat shapes, which allows them to jump off the page and become objects you can hold in your hands, like a ball or a box!

**Different Kinds of 3D Shapes**

Let's meet some basic 3D shapes and learn how to spot them around us:

1. **Cube** – A cube is like a square but with depth. It has 6 square faces, 12 edges, and 8 corners (also known as vertices). Think of a dice or a Rubik's Cube; that's what a cube looks like!

2. **Sphere** – Spheres are perfectly round, like a basketball or the planet we live on, Earth. Spheres are unique because they have no edges or vertices.

3. **Cylinder** – A cylinder has two circular flat faces on the top and bottom, and one curved side. It is shaped like a can of soup or a tall drinking glass.

4. **Cone** – A cone has a circular base and comes to a point at the top, called the apex. Cones look like party hats or ice-cream cones. They have 1 flat face (the base), 1 curved face, and 1 vertex at the top.

5. **Rectangular Prism** – A rectangular prism looks like a stretched-out cube. It has 6 faces too, but unlike the cube, not all faces are square – some are rectangles. Think of a shoebox or a brick.

6. **Pyramid** – A pyramid has a base that can be any shape – like a square or a triangle – and it has faces that are triangles meeting at the top or the apex. The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt is an example of a square-based pyramid.

**Explore and Find Exercise**

Before we start the exercises, let's explore! Look around your room or think of objects you know and write one example of each 3D shape from our list.

**Identifying 3D Shapes Exercise**

Now, let's practice identifying 3D shapes in the drawings below:

(Drawings of various 3D shapes are presented)

1. This shape has 6 square faces. What is it? Answer: Cube.
2. This round shape looks like a ball. What is it? Answer: Sphere.
3. This shape has 2 circular faces and a curved surface. What is it? Answer: Cylinder.
4. This shape looks like an ice cream cone. What is it? Answer: Cone.
5. This shape looks like a box you might pack things in. What is it? Answer: Rectangular Prism.
6. This shape has a square base and 4 triangular faces. What is it? Answer: Pyramid.

Great job identifying the shapes! Remember, 3D shapes are everywhere in the world around us. Keep looking for them, and you'll become a 3D shape expert in no time!
