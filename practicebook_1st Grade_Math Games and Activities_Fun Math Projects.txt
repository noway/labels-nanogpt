## Project 1: Math Bingo
**Objective:** To practice number recognition and counting skills.

**Materials:**
- Bingo cards with numbers from 1 to 20
- Small tokens or counters
- A set of number cards from 1 to 20

**Instructions:**
1. Each student gets a Bingo card filled with random numbers from 1 to 20.
2. The teacher (or a student) randomly selects a number card and calls out the number.
3. Students place a token on their Bingo card if they have the called number.
4. The first student to get five tokens in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) shouts “Bingo!” and wins.

**Example of a Completed Exercise:**
Let's say the winning student's Bingo card had the following tokens placed on numbers 3, 7, 14, 18, and 20 in a horizontal row.

## Project 2: Shape Safari
**Objective:** To recognize and classify shapes.

**Materials:**
- A collection of shape cutouts (circles, squares, triangles, rectangles)
- A large piece of poster paper
- Glue sticks

**Instructions:**
1. Spread out the shape cutouts on a table.
2. Have each student pick out a set number of each shape.
3. Students create an imaginative picture on poster paper using the shapes, making sure to tell a story.
4. Once complete, they classify their shapes by gluing them onto the paper in separate "shape zones."

**Example of a Completed Exercise:**
A student's story featured the following shapes: 6 circles for the sun and apples on a tree, 4 squares for the windows of a house, 3 triangles for the roof and a pine tree, and 2 rectangles for the door and the trunk of the tree.

## Project 3: Addition Art
**Objective:** To practice addition skills up to 20.

**Materials:**
- Large sheet of paper or small poster board
- Crayons or markers
- A list of simple addition problems

**Instructions:**
1. Each student receives a list of addition problems.
2. For each correct answer, they draw a part of a predetermined image.
3. Each part of the image corresponds to an addition problem; the final picture comes to life as problems are solved.

**Example of a Completed Exercise:**
The image is of a house with a tree. The addition problems and their corresponding parts were:

- 5 + 3 (answer: 8) for the base of the house
- 1 + 4 (answer: 5) for the door
- 2 + 6 (answer: 8) for the windows
- 4 + 4 (answer: 8) for the roof
- 7 + 2 (answer: 9) for the sun
- 6 + 1 (answer: 7) for the tree trunk

## Project 4: Number Storybooks
**Objective:** To create stories that incorporate math.

**Materials:**
- Blank booklet or stapled pages
- Crayons, markers, or pencils
- Stickers or stamps (optional)

**Instructions:**
1. Each student creates a short story that includes a math problem within the narrative.
2. They illustrate and write the story in the booklet.
3. At the end of the book, they include the math problem and show how to solve it.

**Example of a Completed Exercise:**
A student wrote a story about "5 fish in the sea who met 3 new friends." At the end of the story, the problem was "How many fish are there now?" with illustrations accompanying it. The answer, shown in the back, was 5 + 3 = 8.
