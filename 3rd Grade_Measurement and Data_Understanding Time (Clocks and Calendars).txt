**Reading Time on Analog Clocks**

An _analog clock_ has a round face with numbers from 1 to 12, three hands – a short one for the hour, a long one for minutes, and sometimes a very thin one for seconds.

**For Example:**
- When the short (hour) hand is pointing to 3 and the long (minutes) hand is pointing to 12, it is 3:00. 
- If the hour hand is on the 7 and the minutes hand has moved halfway around the clock to the bottom, it's 7:30.

*Exercise 1:* Draw the time 2:45 on an analog clock.

*Answer 1:* The short hand should be between the 2 and 3, closer to the 3, while the long hand points directly at the 9.

**Understanding A.M. and P.M.**

Time is divided into two segments:
- A.M. — from Midnight to Noon.
- P.M. — from Noon to Midnight.

Anything happening before noon (12:00) is in the A.M. hours. Anything happening after noon and until midnight is in the P.M. hours.

*Exercise 2:* Is 6 o'clock in the evening 6:00 A.M. or 6:00 P.M.?

*Answer 2:* 6:00 in the evening is 6:00 P.M.

**Hours, Minutes, and Seconds**

There are 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute.

**Minutes and Hours**

When the long hand completes a full circle, it is 60 minutes or 1 hour.

*Exercise 3:* What time will it be 30 minutes after 11:00 A.M.?

*Answer 3:* It will be 11:30 A.M. 

**Seconds**
If your clock has a second hand, when it goes around once, 60 seconds have passed, or 1 minute.

*Exercise 4:* How many seconds are there in 2 minutes?

*Answer 4:* There are 120 seconds in 2 minutes because 60 seconds per minute times 2 minutes equals 120 seconds.

**Using Calendars**

A calendar shows days, weeks, and months in a year.

**Days and Weeks**
Each square on a calendar represents one day. There are 7 days in a week: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.

**Months**
There are 12 months in a year, and each month has a different number of days (28 to 31 days).

*Exercise 5:* What month comes after March?

*Answer 5:* April comes after March.

**Special Dates**
Some dates, like holidays or birthdays, might be special to you. We can mark these on the calendar.

*Exercise 6:* Mark your birthday on a calendar, and write down which day of the week it falls on.

*Answer 6:* [This will vary based on the student's birthday.]
