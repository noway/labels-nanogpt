## Understanding Hours and Minutes

Welcome to the "Understanding Hours and Minutes" section of our "Telling Time" chapter! Time is all around us, from when we wake up in the morning until we go to bed at night. Knowing how to tell time is a very important skill that you will use every day. Let's dive in and learn about hours and minutes on a clock.

### What is Time?

Time is a way to measure moments. It can measure moments that are short, like when you blink, or long, like when you're at school. We use clocks to help us know what time it is during the day.

### The Clock

A clock has numbers from 1 to 12 in a circle. There are also two hands, a short hand and a long hand. 

- The short hand shows the hour. 
- The long hand shows the minutes.

### Hours

One full turn around the clock by the short hand is 12 hours long. A day has 24 hours, so we talk about time in two parts: AM (morning) and PM (afternoon and night).

### Minutes

The long hand counts minutes, and it moves faster than the short hand. There are 60 minutes in one hour. When the long hand moves from one number to the next, that is 5 minutes.

### How to Read the Time

To read the time, first look at the short hand to see what hour it is. Then look at the long hand to find out the minutes.

For example:
- If the short hand is on the 3 and the long hand is on the 12, it is 3:00. This is also called "three o'clock."
- If the short hand is between the 3 and the 4, and the long hand is on the 6, it is half-past three, or 3:30.

### Exercise 1: Reading the Clock

Draw the hands on the clock to show the following times. Then, write the time.

1. 2:00
2. 5:30
3. 7:15
4. 8:45
5. 10:30

### Answers to Exercise 1:

1. Draw the short hand on the 2 and the long hand on the 12. The time is 2:00.
2. Draw the short hand halfway between the 5 and the 6 and the long hand on the 6. The time is 5:30.
3. Draw the short hand slightly past the 7 and the long hand on the 3. The time is 7:15.
4. Draw the short hand nearly on the 9 and the long hand on the 9. The time is 8:45.
5. Draw the short hand halfway between the 10 and the 11 and the long hand on the 6. The time is 10:30.

### Exercise 2: Write the Time

Look at the clocks shown below and write the time. (Show pictures of clocks with different times)

### Answers to Exercise 2:

(Provide answers based on the pictures of the clocks that are shown in the exercise)

Great job! Now you know how to read hours and minutes on the clock. Keep practicing, and soon you'll be a time-telling expert!

Remember, knowing how to tell time helps us to be on time for important things like school, meals, and playtime. Keep practicing, and have fun telling time!
