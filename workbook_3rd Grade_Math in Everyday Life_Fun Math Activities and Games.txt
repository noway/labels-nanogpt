### Fun Math Activities and Games

### 1. Grocery Store Math

#### Instructions:
Let’s pretend we’re going shopping! Below is a list of things you might find at a grocery store with their prices. Your job is to add up the prices of the items to find the total cost of your shopping trip.

- Apples: $0.30 each
- Bananas: $0.25 each
- Carrots: $0.50 per bag
- Bread: $2.00 per loaf
- Milk: $2.50 per gallon

You want to buy 4 apples, 5 bananas, 2 bags of carrots, 1 loaf of bread, and 1 gallon of milk. Add up the total cost of these items.

#### Completed Exercise:
4 Apples: 4 x $0.30 = $1.20
5 Bananas: 5 x $0.25 = $1.25
2 bags of Carrots: 2 x $0.50 = $1.00
1 loaf of Bread: 1 x $2.00 = $2.00
1 gallon of Milk: 1 x $2.50 = $2.50

Total Cost: $1.20 + $1.25 + $1.00 + $2.00 + $2.50 = $8.95

#### Answer:
Your total cost for the shopping trip is $8.95.


### 2. Recipe Ratios

#### Instructions:
You’re going to help bake cookies! Use the recipe below to find out how many ingredients you need if you wanted to make both half a batch of cookies and double a batch.

Original Recipe:
- Flour: 2 cups
- Sugar: 1 cup
- Butter: 0.5 cups (1 stick)
- Chocolate Chips: 1.5 cups

#### Completed Exercise:
Half Batch (divide each ingredient by 2):
- Flour: 2 cups / 2 = 1 cup
- Sugar: 1 cup / 2 = 0.5 cups
- Butter: 0.5 cups / 2 = 0.25 cups
- Chocolate Chips: 1.5 cups / 2 = 0.75 cups

Double Batch (multiply each ingredient by 2):
- Flour: 2 cups x 2 = 4 cups
- Sugar: 1 cup x 2 = 2 cups
- Butter: 0.5 cups x 2 = 1 cup (2 sticks)
- Chocolate Chips: 1.5 cups x 2 = 3 cups

#### Answer:
For half a batch, you need 1 cup of flour, 0.5 cups of sugar, 0.25 cups of butter, and 0.75 cups of chocolate chips.
For a double batch, you need 4 cups of flour, 2 cups of sugar, 1 cup of butter, and 3 cups of chocolate chips.


### 3. Time Challenge

#### Instructions:
Use the clocks drawn below for a fun 'time-telling' challenge. Write down what time each clock shows.

(Show different clock faces with times such as 3:00, 7:45, 12:30, 8:15)

#### Completed Exercise:
Clock 1: 3:00 PM
Clock 2: 7:45 AM
Clock 3: 12:30 PM
Clock 4: 8:15 PM

#### Answer:
Clock 1 shows 3:00 PM. Clock 2 shows 7:45 AM. Clock 3 shows 12:30 PM. Clock 4 shows 8:15 PM.


### 4. Math Bingo

#### Instructions:
Create your own Math Bingo sheets with a free space in the middle. Randomly fill the spaces with numbers from simple math problems that you must solve first. For example, if you put "5+4" in a space, you will fill that same space with the number "9".

You will need someone to call out math problems, and you mark the answer if you have it on your sheet. The first to get five in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins!

#### Completed Exercise:
- Students will have variations of Math Bingo sheets, and the outcome will depend on the game played among several students, so there is no one fixed answer. Make sure the numbers on the Bingo cards are results from problems appropriate for their level of math knowledge.

### 5. Measurement Hunt

#### Instructions:
Using a ruler or a measuring tape, go around your house and measure 5 objects. Write down the name of each object and its length in inches.

#### Completed Exercise:
1. Sofa – 84 inches
2. Book – 11 inches
3. Pencil – 7 inches
4. Table – 60 inches
5. Shoe – 10 inches

#### Answer:
The measured lengths of the objects found during the Measurement Hunt will vary depending on the student's chosen objects, but they should be able to demonstrate the ability to measure correctly and record their findings.

#### Remember:
Math can be a lot of fun, and these activities show you how it is used in everyday life. Keep practicing, and you'll see how numbers, measurements, and calculations are a big part of the world around you!
