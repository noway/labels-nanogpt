# Subtracting with Pictures

Welcome to the "Subtracting with Pictures" section of our "Subtraction Stories" chapter! In this part, we'll learn about subtraction by using pictures to help us understand how subtraction works. First, let's remember what subtraction means. When we subtract, we take away a certain number from another number to see what's left.

### What is Subtraction with Pictures?

Subtraction with pictures is a fun way to learn how to subtract! Instead of just using numbers, we will use pictures of things like fruits, animals, toys, or any objects that you can count. These pictures help us to see the subtraction happen right in front of our eyes, which makes it easier to understand.

### Let's Begin With an Example

Imagine you have 5 apples, and you eat 2 of them. How many apples do you have left? Let's draw it and count.

🍎🍎🍎🍎🍎 - Before eating any apples, you have 5.

Now, cross out 2 apples to show that you've eaten them.

🍎🍎🍎~~🍎~~🍎 - After eating, we crossed out 2 apples.

How many apples are not crossed out? Let's count them.

🍎🍎🍎 - We have 3 apples not crossed out.

So, if you had 5 apples and you ate 2, you'd have 3 apples left.

5 apples - 2 apples = 3 apples

### Exercise 1

1. There are 6 balloons. 🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈 Three balloons pop! How many are left?
- Cross out 3 balloons to show that they popped.
- Count the balloons that are not crossed out.
- Write the subtraction sentence.

**Answer**:
🎈🎈🎈~~🎈~~🎈🎈 - 3 balloons are crossed out.
We have 3 balloons left.
6 balloons - 3 balloons = 3 balloons

### Exercise 2

1. You have 4 slices of pizza. 🍕🍕🍕🍕. You share 2 slices with a friend. How many slices do you have now?
- Cross out 2 slices you gave to your friend to show they're gone.
- Count the remaining slices.
- Write the subtraction sentence.

**Answer**:
🍕🍕~~🍕~~🍕 - 2 slices are crossed out.
You have 2 slices of pizza left.
4 slices - 2 slices = 2 slices

### Exercise 3

1. There are 8 flowers. 🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸. Some flowers wilt, and now there are only 5 flowers that look nice. How many flowers wilted?
- Cross out the flowers that wilted to find out how many there are.
- Count how many flowers are crossed out.
- Write the subtraction sentence.

**Answer**:
🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸 - Before
🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸~~🌸~~~~🌸~~~~🌸~~ - 3 wilted flowers are crossed out.
3 flowers wilted.
8 flowers - 3 flowers = 5 flowers

### Exercise 4: Let's Try Together!

Here is a group of 7 toy cars: 🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗. You decide to give away 4 cars to your friends. How many cars do you have left?

- Let's cross out 4 cars.
- Count the number of cars that are still there.
- Now, write the subtraction sentence.

**Do it Yourself**:

_(Cross out the cars you gave away and write the answer below)_

**Answer**:
🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗🚗 - 4 cars are crossed out.
🚗🚗🚗 are not crossed out.
You have 3 toy cars left.
7 toy cars - 4 toy cars = 3 toy cars

### Practice Makes Perfect

Now, it's your turn to try some subtraction problems with pictures. Remember, you can draw anything you like to help you subtract or use stickers to make it more fun!

### Tips for Parents and Teachers

Encourage children to take their time with these exercises and to enjoy the process of counting and subtracting with the help of pictures. If they feel comfortable, you can ask them to come up with their subtraction stories and draw the corresponding pictures to solve these equations.

Happy Subtracting!
