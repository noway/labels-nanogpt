# Understanding Numbers: Even and Odd Numbers

## What are Even and Odd Numbers?

When we start to explore the world of numbers, we see that they have unique characteristics. Two very special types are called **even** and **odd numbers**. Understanding even and odd numbers helps us to group and organize numbers in interesting ways.

### Even Numbers

An **even number** is any whole number that can be divided by 2 without leaving any remainder. That means if you split an even number into two equal groups, there won't be any leftovers. Another way to recognize an even number is to look at the last digit (the digit on the far right). If the last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, then the number is even.

**Examples of Even Numbers:**  
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and so on.

### Odd Numbers

An **odd number**, on the other hand, has a remainder of 1 when you divide it by 2. If you try to split an odd number into two equal groups, you will always have one left over. Just like with even numbers, you can look at the last digit to tell if a number is odd. If the last digit is 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9, then the number is odd.

**Examples of Odd Numbers:**  
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and so forth.

## Let's Practice!

Now that you know how to identify even and odd numbers, let's do some exercises.

**Exercise 1:**  
Is the number 16 even or odd?  
**Answer:** Even (because it ends in 6, and when you divide 16 by 2, you get 8, which is a whole number without a remainder).

**Exercise 2:**  
Is the number 23 even or odd?  
**Answer:** Odd (because it ends in 3, and dividing 23 by 2 leaves a remainder).

**Exercise 3:**  
Circle the even numbers: 4, 11, 18, 23, 30.  
**Answer:** 4, 18, 30.

**Exercise 4:**  
Put a checkmark next to the odd numbers: 7, 12, 20, 25, 33.  
**Answer:** ✓7, ✓25, ✓33.

## Let’s Try Some More Together! 

**Exercise 5:**  
Is the number 45 even or odd? Write down your answer.

**Exercise 6:**  
Write the next two even numbers after 10.

**Exercise 7:**  
Write the next two odd numbers after 15.

**Exercise 8:**  
Count by twos from 2 to 14 and circle the odd numbers you encounter.

**Exercise 9:**  
Look around your room and count how many objects there are. Is the total number even or odd?

### Answers to Exercise 5-9:

**Exercise 5 Answer:**  
Odd (it ends in 5, which is an odd number).

**Exercise 6 Answer:**  
12 and 14 (since these follow after 10 and end in even digits).

**Exercise 7 Answer:**  
17 and 19 (these are the next numbers after 15 that end in odd digits).

**Exercise 8 Answer:**  
No odd numbers while counting by twos, starting from 2 (all are even).

**Exercise 9 Answer:**  
The answer will vary depending on the count of objects. (Use the even-odd rule to determine the answer).

Great job! By practicing these exercises, you're becoming a pro at identifying even and odd numbers. Keep practicing, and you will be able to spot these numbers everywhere!
