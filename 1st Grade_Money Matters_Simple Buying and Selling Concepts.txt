## Chapter: Simple Buying and Selling Concepts

### Introduction to Money

Welcome to the exciting world of money! Money helps us buy things we want and need. When we buy something, we exchange money for the item we want. When we sell something, someone gives us money for the item. Let's learn about how this works!

### Understanding Currency

Before we start buying and selling, let's talk about what money looks like. We use coins like pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters. We also use paper money like one dollar bills, five dollar bills, and ten dollar bills.

Each coin and bill is worth a different amount of money. Here's how much each one is worth:

- A penny is worth 1 cent ($0.01).
- A nickel is worth 5 cents ($0.05).
- A dime is worth 10 cents ($0.10).
- A quarter is worth 25 cents ($0.25).
- A one dollar bill is worth 100 cents or 1 dollar ($1.00).
- A five dollar bill is worth 500 cents or 5 dollars ($5.00).
- A ten dollar bill is worth 1000 cents or 10 dollars ($10.00).

### How to Buy Things

When you buy things, you need to give the right amount of money that matches the item's price.

**Example 1:**
You want to buy a toy car that costs 25 cents. You can give the shopkeeper:
- One quarter OR
- Two dimes and one nickel OR
- Twenty-five pennies.

Choose a way to pay the exact price.

**Exercise 1:**
You see a cookie priced at 10 cents. What coins can you use to buy it?

Answer:
You can use:
- One dime OR
- Two nickels OR
- Ten pennies.

**Exercise 2:**
You want to buy a sticker for 2 cents. How do you pay for it?

Answer:
You can use:
- Two pennies.

### Getting Change

Sometimes, you give more money than the item's cost. When this happens, you get money back. That money is called "change."

**Example 2:**
A juice box costs 30 cents, but you give the shopkeeper one dollar bill. How much change should you get back?

1 dollar = 100 cents

100 cents (your money) - 30 cents (cost of juice) = 70 cents (your change)

You should get back 70 cents as change.

**Exercise 3:**
You buy a balloon for 45 cents and give the seller one dollar. How much change will you get back?

Answer:
1 dollar = 100 cents

100 cents (your money) - 45 cents (cost of balloon) = 55 cents (your change)

You get back 55 cents.

### How to Sell Things

When you sell something, you give an item to a buyer, and the buyer gives you money.

**Example 3:**
You sell a pack of pencils for 75 cents. The buyer gives you three quarters. You count the quarters to make sure it's the right amount:
- 1 quarter = 25 cents,
- 2 quarters = 50 cents,
- 3 quarters = 75 cents.

They gave you the correct amount!

**Exercise 4:**
You are selling apples for 5 cents each. A friend wants to buy 4 apples. How much money will your friend give you?

Answer:
- 1 apple = 5 cents,
- 2 apples = 10 cents,
- 3 apples = 15 cents,
- 4 apples = 20 cents.

Your friend will give you 20 cents for 4 apples.

### Practice Problems

Now, let's test what you've learned with some practice problems!

1. You want to buy a notebook that costs 50 cents. You give the shopkeeper two quarters. Do you need any change? Why or why not?

Answer: No, you do not need any change because two quarters equal 50 cents which is the exact price of the notebook.

2. A doll costs $1 and you pay with a five dollar bill. How much change should you get?

Answer: You should get $4 back as change.

3. You sell a book for $3. A customer gives you three one dollar bills. Is this the correct amount?

Answer: Yes, this is the correct amount because three one dollar bills equal $3.

### Conclusion
