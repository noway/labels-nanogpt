**Understanding Area and Perimeter**

Before we start solving exercises, let's make sure we understand what area and perimeter mean.

The **area** of a shape is the amount of space inside that shape. We measure area in square units (like square inches, square feet, or square meters).

The **perimeter** of a shape is the total distance around the edge of the shape. We measure perimeter in linear units (like inches, feet, or meters).

Let's go through how to calculate the area and perimeter for some common shapes:

1. **Rectangle:**
   Area = length × width
   Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)

2. **Square:**
   Area = side × side (or side squared)
   Perimeter = 4 × side

**Practice Exercises**

Now it's time to practice what you've learned. Try to calculate the area and perimeter of the following shapes:

1. Rectangle with a length of 5 units and a width of 3 units.
   - Area = 5 × 3 = 15 square units
   - Perimeter = 2 × (5 + 3) = 16 units

2. Square with a side length of 4 units.
   - Area = 4 × 4 = 16 square units
   - Perimeter = 4 × 4 = 16 units

For each shape, fill in the blanks with the correct numbers to complete the equations.

**Answers**

*Here are the answers for the exercises you just completed.*

1. A rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 6 units.
   - Area = 8 × 6 = 48 square units
   - Perimeter = 2 × (8 + 6) = 28 units

2. A square with a side length of 7 units.
   - Area = 7 × 7 = 49 square units
   - Perimeter = 4 × 7 = 28 units

3. A rectangle with a length of 10 units and a width of 2 units.
   - Area = 10 × 2 = 20 square units
   - Perimeter = 2 × (10 + 2) = 24 units

4. This solution will vary depending on the shape you created. Remember the formulas for area and perimeter for the shape you chose (or combine them if it's a complex shape), and apply them accordingly.
