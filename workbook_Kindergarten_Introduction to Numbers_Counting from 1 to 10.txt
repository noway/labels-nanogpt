# Introduction to Numbers
## Counting from 1 to 10

Hello young learner! Today we are going to embark on a wonderful journey into the world of numbers. Numbers are like little friends who will help you count all sorts of things, like your toys, the number of apples in a basket, and even the stars in the sky. Let's begin our adventure by getting familiar with the numbers from 1 to 10.

### Let's Learn to Count!

Counting is just like a fun game. When we count, we start from the number 1 and then go up one number at a time. Let's practice by counting together:

**1** - Say "one."
**2** - Now say "two."
**3** - After two comes "three."
**4** - Then we say "four."
**5** - Halfway there with "five."
**6** - Next is "six."
**7** - Lucky number "seven."
**8** - Don't be late to say "eight."
**9** - Almost there with "nine."
**10** - Great job! You've reached "ten."
