## Fun with Shapes

### Counting Sides and Corners

Hello young mathematicians! Today we're going to have some geometric fun by exploring different shapes and learning how to count their sides and corners. Remember, the sides of a shape are the straight lines that make up the outline of the shape, and the corners, also known as vertices, are the points where two sides meet.

#### Exercise 1: Counting Sides
Look at each shape below, count the number of sides it has, and write your answer in the space provided.

1. Square
     <|image|>

     Number of sides: ____

2. Triangle
     <|image|>

     Number of sides: ____

3. Rectangle
     <|image|>

     Number of sides: ____

4. Hexagon
     <|image|>

     Number of sides: ____

5. Pentagon
     <|image|>

     Number of sides: ____

**Answers:**

1. Square - 4 sides
2. Triangle - 3 sides
3. Rectangle - 4 sides
4. Hexagon - 6 sides
5. Pentagon - 5 sides

#### Exercise 2: Counting Corners
Now, it's time to count the corners or vertices. Look at each shape and count the number of corners. Write your answer in the space provided.

1. Square
     <|image|>

     Number of corners: ____

2. Triangle
     <|image|>

     Number of corners: ____

3. Rectangle
     <|image|>

     Number of corners: ____

4. Hexagon
     <|image|>

     Number of corners: ____

5. Pentagon
     <|image|>

     Number of corners: ____

**Answers:**

1. Square - 4 corners
2. Triangle - 3 corners
3. Rectangle - 4 corners
4. Hexagon - 6 corners
5. Pentagon - 5 corners

#### Exercise 3: Real-Life Shapes
Look around your classroom or home. Can you find objects that match the shapes you've learned about? Write down the object and the shape that it resembles.

Example:

Object: Clock
Shape: Circle

1. Object: ____________
   Shape: ____________

2. Object: ____________
   Shape: ____________

3. Object: ____________
   Shape: ____________

*Now let's see your observations!*

#### Review Questions

1. What shape has 4 equal sides and 4 equal corners?
2. How many sides does a hexagon have?
3. What is special about the sides of a rectangle?

**Answers:**

1. A square has 4 equal sides and 4 equal corners.
2. A hexagon has 6 sides.
3. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal in length.

Great job counting sides and corners! Shapes are all around us, and learning about them can be a lot of fun. Keep practicing, and soon you'll be a shape expert!
