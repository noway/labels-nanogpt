# Shapes and Sizes

## Size Comparison

### Learn about Comparing Sizes!

Hello young learner! In this section, we will learn how to compare the size of different shapes and objects. Size comparison is just a way of looking at things to tell which one is bigger, smaller, or if they are the same size. We'll use words like "big", "small", "bigger", "smaller", "tallest", "shortest", "longer", "shorter", "same size", and "equal" to describe these sizes. So let's begin our size comparison adventure!

### Activity 1: Big or Small?

Look at the pairs of shapes below. Circle the one that is BIGGER.

1. A big circle and a small circle.
2. A big square and a small square.
3. A big triangle and a small triangle.

**Answers for Activity 1:**

1. You should have circled the big circle.
2. You should have circled the big square.
3. You should have circled the big triangle.

Now, can you find an object in your room that is big and something that is small? Draw them in your workbook!

### Activity 2: Letâ€™s Compare Heights!

Here we have pictures of different things. Write "taller" or "shorter" underneath each picture to compare the first object with the second one.

1. A tall tree and a short bush.
2. A tall giraffe and a short cat.
3. A tall building and a short house.

**Answers for Activity 2:**

1. The tree is taller than the bush.
2. The giraffe is taller than the cat.
3. The building is taller than the house.

Can you stand next to a friend or a family member? Who is taller and who is shorter? Draw a picture showing both of you with the correct size.

### Activity 3: Longer or Shorter?

Draw a line next to each object to show one that is LONGER and one that is SHORTER.

1. A long train and a short bus.
2. A long snake and a short worm.
3. A long pencil and a short eraser.

**Answers for Activity 3:**

1. You should have drawn a longer line next to the train and a shorter line next to the bus.
2. You should have drawn a longer line next to the snake and a shorter line next to the worm.
3. You should have drawn a longer line next to the pencil and a shorter line next to the eraser.

Find two things in your classroom or home, one longer and one shorter. What are they? Describe them in your workbook.

### Challenge Activity: Same Size or Not?

Look at these pairs of objects. Circle "Yes" if they are the same size, or "No" if they are not the same size.

1. Two blocks: (Yes / No)
2. Two leaves: (Yes / No)
3. Two books: (Yes / No)

**Answers for Challenge Activity:**

1. <|unsolvedproblem|>
2. Usually, leaves are not the same size, so most likely "No".
3. If the books look the same height and width, then "Yes"; if one looks bigger, then "No".

Can you find any two objects around you that are the same size? Draw them in your workbook and label them "same size".

Remember, comparing sizes helps us understand the world around us. Keep practicing, and you'll be a size comparison expert in no time!
