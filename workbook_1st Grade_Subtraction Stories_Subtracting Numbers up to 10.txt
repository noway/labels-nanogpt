**Subtracting Numbers up to 10**

Hey there, young mathematicians! Today we are going to become subtraction detectives and solve some fun subtraction stories! Subtraction is just a way of finding out how many are left when we take some away. Always remember, when we subtract, the number gets smaller.

Let's dive in and figure out these number puzzles!

**Subtraction Story 1:**
Anna had 5 beautiful flowers. She gave 2 of them to her friend. How many flowers does Anna have left? To solve this, we do 5 minus 2 equals what? 

If you have a piece of paper, you can draw 5 flowers and cross out 2 of them to see how many are left. 
We write it like this:
5 - 2 = 3

**Answer:** Anna has 3 flowers left.

**Subtraction Story 2:**
There are 7 yummy cupcakes on the plate. Ben ate 3 cupcakes. How many cupcakes are on the plate now? We subtract 3 from 7 to find the answer.

Draw the 7 cupcakes and then cross out 3 of them to see how many are left untouched. 
Let's calculate:
7 - 3 = 4

**Answer:** There are 4 cupcakes left on the plate.

**Subtraction Story 3:**
Sara has 10 colorful crayons. She lost 4 of them somewhere in the house. How many crayons does she have now? We take away 4 from 10 to solve this problem.

You can count out 10 crayons (or use blocks or counters), then take 4 away and count how many are left.
So, we will subtract like this:
10 - 4 = 6 

**Answer:** Sara has 6 crayons remaining.

**Subtraction Story 4:**
9 birds were sitting on a fence. 5 birds flew away to find some food. How many birds are still sitting on the fence? We have to subtract 5 from 9.

Picture those 9 birds on a fence. When 5 fly away, count how many birds you see sitting calmly on the fence.
We will subtract:
9 - 5 = 4

**Answer:** There are 4 birds still on the fence.

**Subtraction Story 5:**
Tom had 8 balloons. The wind blew away 1 balloon. How many balloons does Tom have now? This is 8 minus 1.

Imagine holding 8 balloons. If the wind takes 1 away, how many are you holding now?
We do the subtraction like this:
8 - 1 = 7

**Answer:** Tom has 7 balloons left.

Now, remember these steps. When we face subtraction stories, we:

1. Read the story and understand what is being taken away.
2. Illustrate the story with drawings, counters or use our fingers to help.
3. Write down the subtraction sentence (e.g., 6 -2 = 4).
4. Do the subtraction to find the answer.
5. Check if the answer makes sense with the story.

Good job solving those stories! The more you practice, the better detective you'll become in discovering the answers to these subtraction mysteries. Keep up the great work, detectives!
