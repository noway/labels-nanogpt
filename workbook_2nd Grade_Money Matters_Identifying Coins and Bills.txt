### Answers

#### Exercise 1: Match the Coin

- Penny → 1 cent
- Nickel → 5 cents
- Dime → 10 cents
- Quarter → 25 cents

#### Exercise 2: Bill Identification

- $1 Bill → George Washington
- $5 Bill → Abraham Lincoln
- $10 Bill → Alexander Hamilton
- $20 Bill → Andrew Jackson

#### Exercise 3: Coin Values

1. 3 Pennies + 2 Nickels = 3(1 cent) + 2(5 cents) = 3 cents + 10 cents = 13 cents
2. 4 Dimes + 1 Quarter = 4(10 cents) + 1(25 cents) = 40 cents + 25 cents = 65 cents (or $0.65)
3. 1 Nickel + 1 Dime + 3 Quarters = 1(5 cents) + 1(10 cents) + 3(25 cents) = 5 cents + 10 cents + 75 cents = 90 cents (or $0.90)

#### Exercise 4: Making Change

Toy car = $3.75
You give = $5.00

Change = $5.00 - $3.75 = $1.25

You will get $1.25 back in change.
