## Comparing Fractions

### Understanding Fractions
Before we learn how to compare fractions, let's remember what a fraction is! A fraction is a part of a whole. It is made up of two numbers: the numerator, which is the top number, and the denominator, which is the bottom number. The denominator tells us into how many equal parts the whole is divided, and the numerator tells us how many of those parts we have.

### Comparing Fractions with the Same Denominator
When two fractions have the same denominator, it is easy to compare them. You just look at the numerators. The fraction with the bigger numerator is the bigger fraction.

#### Example 1
Which is larger: 3/8 or 5/8?

Since the denominators are the same (8), we just look at the numerators. Because 5 is greater than 3, 5/8 is larger than 3/8.

#### Practice Problems
1. Which is larger: 2/7 or 4/7?
2. Which is larger: 5/9 or 3/9?
3. Which is smaller: 1/6 or 4/6?

#### Answers
1. 4/7 is larger because 4 is greater than 2.
2. 5/9 is larger because 5 is greater than 3.
3. 1/6 is smaller because 1 is less than 4.

### Comparing Fractions with the Same Numerator
When two fractions have the same numerator, the one with the smaller denominator is the larger fraction. This is because the same amount is being divided into fewer pieces, making each piece larger.

#### Example 2
Which is larger: 3/4 or 3/8?

Both fractions have the same numerator (3), but the denominators are different. We have the number 3 divided into 4 parts and into 8 parts. The fraction 3/4 is larger because the pieces are bigger (the whole is divided into fewer parts).

#### Practice Problems
1. Which is larger: 2/3 or 2/5?
2. Which is smaller: 4/9 or 4/7?
3. Which is larger: 1/2 or 1/8?

#### Answers
1. 2/3 is larger because 3 is less than 5.
2. 4/9 is smaller because 9 is greater than 7.
3. 1/2 is larger because 2 is less than 8.

### Comparing Fractions with Different Numerators and Denominators
To compare fractions with different numerators and denominators, we can use different methods such as finding a common denominator, comparing to a benchmark fraction like 1/2, or by using cross multiplication.

#### Finding a Common Denominator
We can compare fractions by finding a common denominator, which means making the denominators the same. After we do that, we can just compare the numerators, like we learned before.

#### Example 3
Which is larger: 2/5 or 3/8?

Step 1: Find a common denominator. In this case, it's 40 because 5 and 8 both multiply into 40.
Step 2: Convert both fractions. Multiply both the numerator and the denominator of each fraction to get the same denominator.

- For 2/5, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 8 to get 16/40.
- For 3/8, we multiply the numerator and denominator by 5 to get 15/40.

Step 3: Now we compare 16/40 to 15/40. Since 16/40 has a larger numerator, 2/5 is greater than 3/8 when converted to equivalent fractions with the same denominator.

#### Practice Problems
1. Which is larger: 1/3 or 2/7?
2. Which is smaller: 3/4 or 5/6?
3. Compare 7/12 to 2/3.

#### Answers
1. The common denominator is 21. Convert 1/3 to 7/21 and 2/7 to 6/21. 1/3 is larger.
2. The common denominator is 12. Convert 3/4 to 9/12 and 5/6 to 10/12. 3/4 is smaller.
3. The common denominator is 12. 7/12 is already in that form, convert 2/3 to 8/12. 2/3 is larger.

### Comparing Fractions with Benchmarks
Sometimes, you can use 1/2 as a benchmark to compare fractions. If both fractions are less than 1/2 or both are more than 1/2, the fraction closer to 1/2 is the smaller fraction.

#### Example 4
Compare 3/7 to 2/5 without finding a common denominator by using benchmarks.

Both fractions are less than 1/2 because the numerator is less than half of the denominator. Since 3/7 is closer to 1/2 than 2/5, it is larger.

#### Cross Multiplication
Another way to compare fractions is by cross multiplying. If the cross products are not equal, the larger cross product comes from the larger fraction.

#### Example 5
Is 4/9 larger than 5/12?

Multiply the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second fraction and vice versa: 4 * 12 and 5 * 9.

This gives us:
4 * 12 = 48
5 * 9 = 45

Since 48 is larger than 45, 4/9 is larger than 5/12.

### Exercise Set
Compare the following fractions. Use any method you find easiest!

1. 3/5 or 4/7?
2. 5/8 or 7/10?
3. 2/3 or 3/5?
4. 7/8 or 4/5?
5. 1/6 or 1/4?

### Answer Key

1. Common denominator is 35. 3/5 is 21/35, and 4/7 is 20/35. So, 3/5 > 4/7.
2. Common denominator is 40. 5/8 is 25/40, and 7/10 is 28/40. So, 7/10 > 5/8.
3. Common denominator is 15. 2/3 is 10/15, and 3/5 is 9/15. So, 2/3 > 3/5.
4. Common denominator is 40. 7/8 is 35/40, and 4/5 is 32/40. So, 7/8 > 4/5.
5. By cross-multiplication, 1/6 is 4/24, and 1/4 is 6/24. So, 1/4 > 1/6.

Remember, when comparing fractions, take your time to think about the numerators and denominators. Use the method that you feel most comfortable with, and with practice, it will become easier!
