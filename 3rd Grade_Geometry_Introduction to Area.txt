## Chapter X: Introduction to Area 

Hello, young mathematicians! Today, we're going to explore an exciting part of geometry — Area! When you think of area, imagine the space that a shape takes up on a flat surface. 

If you spread a blanket on the ground, the amount of ground it covers is like the area of the blanket. Just like you measure how tall you are using inches or centimeters, you can measure the area of a shape in square units, like square inches (in²) or square centimeters (cm²). 

### What Is Area? 

The area of a shape is the amount of space inside the borders of a shape. We measure this in square units because it's like covering the shape with tiny squares, just like tiles on a floor.

### How to Find Area 

Different shapes have different rules for calculating area. 

#### Area of a Rectangle 

To find the area of a rectangle, we use the formula:

**Area = length × width**

This means you multiply the length of the rectangle by its width.

#### Area of a Square 

A square is just a special kind of rectangle where all the sides have the same length. So, you can calculate the area of a square by multiplying the length of one side by itself.

**Area = side × side**

Or, more simply:

**Area = side²**

### Let's Practice! 

#### Example 1 

Imagine you have a rectangle that is 4 inches long and 3 inches wide. What is its area?

**Solution:** 

Area = length × width = 4 inches × 3 inches = 12 square inches (12 in²)

#### Example 2

Find the area of a square that has sides of length 5 centimeters.

**Solution:** 

Area = side² = 5 cm × 5 cm = 25 square centimeters (25 cm²)

#### Activity

*1. Find the area of a rectangle that is 7 units long and 2 units wide.*

**Solution:** 

Area = 7 units × 2 units = 14 square units

*2. A square has a side length of 9 meters. Calculate its area.*

**Solution:** 

Area = 9 m × 9 m = 81 square meters (81 m²)

*3. If the length of a rectangle is 8 feet and the width is 5 feet, what is the area?*

**Solution:** 

Area = 8 ft × 5 ft = 40 square feet (40 ft²)

*4. Zoe has a rectangular garden that measures 6 yards by 4 yards. How many square yards of area does her garden have?*

**Solution:** 

Area = 6 yd × 4 yd = 24 square yards (24 yd²)

*5. Draw a square with sides measuring 3 inches. Calculate its area.*

(For the student to complete)

*6. There is a rectangular door that measures 80 inches in height and 36 inches in width. Find the area of the door.*

**Solution:** 

Area = 80 in × 36 in = 2,880 square inches (2,880 in²)

### What Have We Learned? 

Today we have learned that the area is a measure of the space inside a shape and that it's measured in square units. We found out how to calculate the area of rectangles and squares using simple formulas.

Remember, practice makes perfect, so keep trying these exercises until you feel confident. You are becoming great geometry explorers!

Now that we understand area, we can use it for so many things! From finding out how much paint we need for a wall to planning where to plant flowers in a garden. We can’t wait to see how you use your new knowledge of area in the real world! 

Happy measuring!

Note: Illustrations and visual aids are highly recommended in a real textbook to help students conceptualize area and provide visual step-by-step instructions on how to calculate it. Interactive exercises and exploratory activities also enhance learning and retention.
