# Understanding Numbers - Even and Odd Numbers - 2nd Grade Level

## Introduction to Even and Odd Numbers

Even and odd numbers are two categories that every whole number (also known as counting numbers) can fit into. Even numbers are numbers that can be divided evenly into two groups without any leftovers, while odd numbers are numbers that cannot be divided evenly into two groups—there's always one left over.

Now, let’s dive deeper into understanding even and odd numbers!

## What Are Even Numbers?

Even numbers are numbers that end with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. 

For example:
- 2 is an even number because we can make two groups of 1 out of it.
- 4 is an even number because we can make two groups of 2 out of it.
- 10 is an even number because we can make two groups of 5 out of it.

If you can share it fairly between two people, then it's even.

## What Are Odd Numbers?

Odd numbers are numbers that end with 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. 

For example:
- 1 is an odd number because if we try to divide it between two people, one person will get a number and the other will get nothing.
- 3 is an odd number because we can make only one group of 2, and there's 1 left over.
- 9 is an odd number because we can make four groups of 2, but there's still 1 left over.

If there's always one left out when trying to share between two people, then it's odd.

## Activity 1: Identifying Even and Odd Numbers

Look at the numbers below. Circle the even numbers in blue and the odd numbers in red.

2, 5, 8, 10, 13, 17, 6, 19, 22, 27

### Answers for Activity 1:

Even Numbers (circled in blue): 2, 8, 10, 6, 22
Odd Numbers (circled in red): 5, 13, 17, 19, 27

## Activity 2: Sorting To Find Out

For each number, make two groups and see if you can divide them evenly. If you can, it's even. If there's one left over, it's odd. Write "Even" or "Odd" next to the number.

1, 4, 7, 12, 15, 18, 20, 23

### Answers for Activity 2:

1 - Odd
4 - Even
7 - Odd
12 - Even
15 - Odd
18 - Even
20 - Even
23 - Odd

## Activity 3: Creating Groups

You have 16 apples. Can you divide them into two equal groups?

You have 9 balloons. Can you divide them into two equal groups?

### Answers for Activity 3:

16 apples - Yes, you can divide 16 apples into two groups of 8. 16 is an even number.

9 balloons - No, you can divide them into one group of 4 and one group of 5, but there's one that doesn't fit. So, you can't divide them equally. 9 is an odd number.

Congratulations! You've learned about even and odd numbers. Remember, even numbers end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, and can be divided into two equal groups. Odd numbers end in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9, and you'll always have one left over when trying to make two equal groups. Keep practicing, and you'll quickly become an expert at figuring out if a number is odd or even!
