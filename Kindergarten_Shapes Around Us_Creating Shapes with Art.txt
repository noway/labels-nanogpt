## Shapes Around Us: Chapter 3 - Creating Shapes with Art

### Introduction to "Creating Shapes with Art"

Hello, little learners and artists! Today we are going to combine two fun activities: learning about shapes and creating art! As we explore, you will discover that shapes are not just in books or on screens; they are everywhere around us. And the best thing is, you can make them yourself!

### Recognizing Basic Shapes

First, let’s remember what shapes we have learned so far:

1. **Circle**: A round shape that looks like the sun or a wheel.
2. **Square**: Has four equal sides, like a cracker or a picture frame.
3. **Rectangle**: Like a square, but with two sides longer, much like a door or a book.
4. **Triangle**: Has three sides and three corners, like a mountain or a slice of pizza.

### Exercise 1: Shape Hunt

**Objective**: Find and draw shapes that you see around you.

**Materials Needed**:
- Blank paper
- Crayons or markers

**Instructions**:
1. Look around your room or house for objects that are in the shape of a circle, square, rectangle, or triangle.
2. Choose one object for each shape.
3. On your paper, try to draw each object, focusing on the shape that it resembles.

**Example**:
- Circle: You might find a clock and draw it.
- Square: Look for a window that is shaped like a square and draw it.
- Rectangle: Your book might be a perfect rectangle. Try drawing that.
- Triangle: Maybe you found a piece of pie or a cheese slice; draw that!

### Activity 2: Shape Collage

**Objective**: Create a collage using cut-out shapes.

**Materials Needed**:
- Construction paper in various colors
- Safety scissors
- Glue stick
- A large sheet of paper or poster board

**Instructions**:
1. With the help of an adult, carefully cut out several shapes from the construction paper. You should have a mix of circles, squares, rectangles, and triangles.
2. Arrange your cut-out shapes on the large sheet of paper to make a fun picture.
3. Once you’re happy with your design, glue the shapes onto the paper.

**Example**:
- Use squares and rectangles to create buildings.
- Circles can be the sun, balloons, or wheels.
- Triangles can be used for trees or the roofs of houses.

### Exercise 3: Connect the Dots to Make a Shape

**Objective**: Practice drawing shapes by connecting dots.

**Materials Needed**:
- Connect-the-dots worksheet with dots arranged in shape outlines (see example exercises below for how to create these)

**Instructions**:
1. Start at the number 1 and draw a line to connect it to the next number.
2. Continue connecting the dots in order until you have drawn a shape.
3. Color in your shape!

**Example Exercise**:
    
    Connect the following dots to see what shapes they make!

    A. Circle: Dots are in a circular pattern. Follow the numbers 1 to 8.
    B. Square: Dots form four corners. Connect the dots numbered 1 to 4.
    C. Rectangle: A longer set of dots, connect 1 to 4.
    D. Triangle: Only 3 dots. Connect dots 1 to 3.

**Answers**:
    
    When you have connected the dots correctly, you should have the following shapes:
    
    A. Circle
    B. Square
    C. Rectangle
    D. Triangle
