# Fun with Measurement: Long and Short

Welcome to the "Fun with Measurement" chapter of our 1st Grade Math Practice Book! In this section, we'll explore the concept of long and short lengths. Understanding length is a key math skill, and comparing items to determine which is longer or shorter is a great way to start. Let's have fun measuring and comparing different things!

### Learn and Discover

`Length` is how long something is from one end to the other end. You can measure length using different units like inches, feet, or even non-standard units like paperclips or your own fingers!

**Short** - When something is not very long from one end to the other, we say it is short.

**Long** - When something has a greater distance from one end to the other, we say it is long.

Let's look at different items and decide if they are long or short compared to each other.

### Activity 1: Comparing Objects

Look at the objects below and circle the longer object in each pair.

1. Pencil vs. Eraser
   - [x] Pencil (Longer)
   - [ ] Eraser (Shorter)

2. Shoe vs. Sock
   - [x] Shoe (Longer)
   - [ ] Sock (Shorter)

3. School Bus vs. Bicycle
   - [x] School Bus (Longer)
   - [ ] Bicycle (Shorter)

4. Crayon vs. Marker
   - [ ] Crayon (Shorter)
   - [x] Marker (Longer)

Great job circling the longer one! Remember, the longer object extends more from one end to the other.

### Activity 2: Long or Short?

Look at the items below and write "Long" or "Short" beside each one based on its length.

1. Ant's Body: Short
2. Garden Hose: Long
3. Classroom Ruler: Long
4. Stapler: Short
5. Train: Long
6. Toy Car: Short

You did it! You understood which items are long and which are short.

### Activity 3: Comparing Lines

Below, you'll see pairs of lines. Write "Longer" or "Shorter" under the line that applies.

1. ----  -----
   - Longer
   - Shorter

2. ------  ------
   - Longer
   - Longer

3. ---------  -----
   - Longer
   - Shorter

Did you notice that some lines are the same length? Great observation! When lines are the same length, we say they are 'equally long' or 'of equal length.'

### Activity 4: Measure with Cubes

Use your counting cubes to measure the length of the items in the pictures. Write the number of cubes long each item is.

1. Book: 7 cubes long
2. Pencil: 5 cubes long
3. Glue Stick: 3 cubes long
4. Scissors: 4 cubes long

By counting how many cubes fit along the length, you've measured it! Measurement can be fun and easy with the right tools.

### Review and Practice

1. Which is longer, your math book or a crayon?
   - [x] Math Book (Answer: Longer)
   - [ ] Crayon (Answer: Shorter)

2. If you have two ribbons, one 6 cubes long and the other 10 cubes long, which is shorter?
   - [x] The 6 cubes long ribbon (Answer: Shorter)
   - [ ] The 10 cubes long ribbon (Answer: Longer)

3. Measure your foot with paperclips. How many paperclips long is it? 
   - Example Answer: 8 paperclips long

### Congratulations!

You've finished the "Long and Short" section of the "Fun with Measurement" chapter! Now, you know how to compare the lengths of different objects and understand the terms 'long' and 'short.' Keep practising, and you'll be a measurement expert in no time!
