# Basic Operations with Fractions

Welcome to the "Basic Operations with Fractions" section of our 3rd Grade math workbook! Fractions may seem tricky at first, but once you understand them, you will see they are just another way to show numbers that are not whole. In this chapter, we will learn about adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing fractions. Let's start with some key terminology and then dive into the operations.

## Key Terms
- **Fraction:** A way to describe a part of a whole. It's written with two numbers, one above the other, separated by a line.
- **Numerator:** The top number in a fraction, indicating the number of parts you have.
- **Denominator:** The bottom number in a fraction, indicating how many parts the whole is divided into.

## Adding Fractions

When adding fractions, the most important thing to remember is that you can only add fractions with the same denominator. If the denominators are different, you must find a common denominator before adding.

### Example:
#### Add 1/4 and 1/4.
Both fractions have the same denominator so you can add the numerators.

**Solution:**

1/4 + 1/4 = (1 + 1)/4 = 2/4

But we're not done yet! We need to make sure our fraction is in simplest form.

2/4 can be simplified to 1/2 because both 2 and 4 can be divided by 2.

**Answer:** 1/2

### Practice Problems:
1. 1/3 + 1/3 = (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3
2. 2/5 + 2/5 = (2 + 2)/5 = 4/5
3. 3/8 + 1/8 = (3 + 1)/8 = 4/8, which simplifies to 1/2.

## Subtracting Fractions

Subtracting fractions is similar to addition—ensure that the fractions have the same denominator, then subtract the numerators.

### Example:
#### Subtract 3/6 from 5/6.
Both fractions have the same denominator.

**Solution:**

5/6 - 3/6 = (5 - 3)/6 = 2/6

Now let's simplify.

2/6 can be simplified to 1/3 because both 2 and 6 can be divided by 2.

**Answer:** 1/3

### Practice Problems:
1. 4/5 - 2/5 = (4 - 2)/5 = 2/5
2. 5/8 - 1/8 = (5 - 1)/8 = 4/8, which simplifies to 1/2.
3. 3/7 - 1/7 = (3 - 1)/7 = 2/7

## Multiplying Fractions

To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.

### Example:
#### Multiply 2/3 and 1/4.
**Solution:**

2/3 * 1/4 = (2 * 1)/(3 * 4) = 2/12

Once again, we simplify.

2/12 simplifies to 1/6, because both 2 and 12 can be divided by 2.

**Answer:** 1/6

### Practice Problems:
1. 1/2 * 1/2 = (1 * 1)/(2 * 2) = 1/4
2. 2/5 * 3/5 = (2 * 3)/(5 * 5) = 6/25
3. 3/4 * 1/3 = (3 * 1)/(4 * 3) = 3/12, which simplifies to 1/4.

## Dividing Fractions

To divide by a fraction, you multiply by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of a fraction is created by swapping its numerator and denominator.

### Example:
#### Divide 1/2 by 1/3.
To divide by 1/3, we multiply by its reciprocal, which is 3/1.

**Solution:**

1/2 ÷ 1/3 = 1/2 * 3/1 = (1 * 3)/(2 * 1) = 3/2

The answer is a fraction greater than 1, known as an improper fraction, and that's okay!

**Answer:** 3/2

### Practice Problems:
1. 1/4 ÷ 1/2 = 1/4 * 2/1 = (1 * 2)/(4 * 1) = 2/4, simplifies to 1/2.
2. 2/3 ÷ 1/6 = 2/3 * 6/1 = (2 * 6)/(3 * 1) = 12/3, simplifies to 4.
3. 5/8 ÷ 1/4 = 5/8 * 4/1 = (5 * 4)/(8 * 1) = 20/8, simplifies to 5/2 or 2 1/2.

Congratulations! You've now practiced all the basic operations with fractions. As with any math skill, the key to mastery is practice. So keep practicing with these problems and any others you encounter, and soon you'll be a fractions pro!
