## Review and Recap

### Ready for 2nd Grade Math!

Congratulations on completing 1st Grade Math! You've learned a lot this year, and now it's time to review what you've mastered. This will help you get ready for the exciting challenges of 2nd Grade Math.

Let's take a look at the key skills you should be comfortable with:

#### 1. Understanding Numbers
You've become a pro at counting objects and can write numbers up to at least 120. You've also practiced comparing numbers using greater than (>), less than (<), and equal to (=) signs.

**Example Exercise:**
Arrange the following numbers in descending order (from largest to smallest):
34, 25, 49, 57, 39

**Answer:**
57, 49, 39, 34, 25

#### 2. Addition
You know how to add numbers within 20 and are beginning to memorize basic addition facts. You've also worked on understanding the concept of adding things together by using objects, pictures, and numbers.

**Example Exercise:**
What is 7 + 5?

**Answer:**
7 + 5 = 12

#### 3. Subtraction
Just like addition, you've learned to subtract numbers within 20 and have started to learn some basic subtraction facts by heart.

**Example Exercise:**
Take away 4 from 11.

**Answer:**
11 - 4 = 7

#### 4. Understanding Shapes
You've learned to identify and describe common shapes such as circles, squares, triangles, and rectangles. You also understand the concepts of above, below, beside, in front of, next to, and behind.

**Example Exercise:**
Draw a triangle below a rectangle.

#### 5. Measurement and Length
You have gained an understanding of measurement using nonstandard units like paper clips or blocks, and you know how to compare the length of different objects.

**Example Exercise:**
Use cubes to measure the length of your pencil.

(Students would place cubes end to end along the length of a pencil and count them.)

#### 6. Data Analysis
You can organize objects into categories and compare which group has more or less. You've also learned to understand and create basic charts or graphs.

**Example Exercise:**
There are 5 apples, 7 bananas, and 3 oranges in the fruit basket. Which fruit has the least amount?

**Answer:**
Oranges have the least amount.

#### 7. Solving Word Problems
Solving simple word problems that involve addition and subtraction within 20 is a crucial skill. You've practiced how to read a problem, think about what it's asking, and then solve it.

**Example Exercise:**
Ali has 9 stickers. He buys 6 more. How many stickers does he have now?

**Answer:**
9 + 6 = 15 stickers

#### 8. Telling Time
You've begun learning to tell time to the hour and half-hour using analog and digital clocks.

**Example Exercise:**
What time does the clock show if the short hand is on the 3 and the long hand is on the 12?

**Answer:**
The clock shows 3:00.

#### 9. Money
You can recognize and know the value of coins like pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents), dimes (10 cents), and quarters (25 cents), and you can count them to find a total value.

**Example Exercise:**
If you have 2 dimes and 1 nickel, how much money do you have?

**Answer:**
2 dimes = 20 cents, 1 nickel = 5 cents. Total = 20 cents + 5 cents = 25 cents.

### Practice Makes Perfect!

Now that you've reviewed these skills, make sure to keep practicing. You can do this by:

- Playing math games.
- Solving word problems from daily life.
- Keeping a journal of shapes you find around your home.
- Using a clock to tell time throughout the day.
- Counting coins and learning about saving money.

Remember, math is everywhere!

Good luck in 2nd Grade! You're going to be great!
