## Simple Subtraction (1-20)

In this section, we are going to practice subtracting numbers from 1 to 20. Subtraction is taking one number away from another. It is the opposite of addition. When we subtract, the number we start with is called the "minuend" and the number we take away is the "subtrahend." The answer we get is the "difference." Let’s get started with some examples!

### Practice Problems

**1.** 10 – 3 = __7__  
Let's take away 3 from 10. That leaves us with 7.

**2.** 15 – 6 = __9__  
When we subtract 6 from 15, we get 9.

**3.** 9 – 4 = __5__  
Four less than 9 is 5.

**4.** 18 – 9 = __9__   
Take away 9 from 18, and you are left with 9.

**5.** 5 – 2 = __3__  
Two less than 5 makes 3.

**6.** 14 – 8 = __6__  
Subtract 8 from 14, and the result is 6.

**7.** 13 – 5 = __8__  
Thirteen take away 5 equals 8.

**8.** 7 – 0 = __7__  
If you subtract 0 from 7, the answer is still 7.

**9.** 20 – 20 = __0__  
When you take 20 from 20, you are left with nothing, or 0.

**10.** 6 – 1 = __5__  
Taking 1 away from 6 gives us 5.

### Let's Subtract More!

**11.** 8 – 7 = __1__  
If we have 8 and subtract 7, we have 1 left.

**12.** 17 – 3 = __14__  
Starting with 17, if we take away 3, we end up with 14.

**13.** 11 – 11 = __0__   
Taking 11 from 11 leaves us with 0.

**14.** 12 – 8 = __4__  
Twelve take away 8 equals 4.

**15.** 19 – 10 = __9__  
Nineteen minus ten is nine.

**16.** 16 – 4 = __12__  
Subtract 4 from 16, and you're left with 12.

**17.** 4 – 3 = __1__  
Four take away 3 leaves us with 1.

**18.** 14 – 7 = __7__  
When you subtract 7 from 14, the number that remains is 7.

**19.** 10 – 10 = __0__  
Ten minus ten gives us 0.

**20.** 20 – 8 = __12__  
If you take 8 from 20, you'll have 12 left.
