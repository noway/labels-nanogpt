## Number Songs and Games

Welcome to the “Number Songs and Games” section of the “Introduction to Numbers” chapter in our Math Workbook for Kindergarteners! Learning numbers can be a lot of fun when we add some tunes and playful activities. In this section, we’ll explore numbers through songs and engaging number games. By the end, children will be familiar with counting from 1 to 10 and will have a solid foundation for basic number recognition.

### Number Songs

#### 1. The Counting Song

(Tune: "Ten Little Indians")

Let’s count to ten, it’s easy to do,
Just follow along and sing it too:
One, two, three little numbers,
Four, five, six little numbers,
Seven, eight, nine little numbers,
Ten little numbers in a row!

Sing this song a few times and shake your fingers or clap your hands as you count each number. It’s a great way to remember the order of the numbers!

#### 2. Five Little Ducks

(Tune: "Five Little Ducks")

Five little ducks went out one day,
Over the hills and far away,
Mother duck said, "Quack, quack, quack, quack!",
But only four little ducks came back.

(Count down one duck each verse until no little ducks come back, then sing the final verse.)

Sad mother duck went out one day,
Over the hills and far away,
Mother duck said, “Quack, quack, quack, quack!”,
And all of the five little ducks came back.

This song is fun and teaches subtraction in a simple way! Every verse one less duck comes back, which shows how numbers decrease when we subtract.

### Number Games

#### 1. Number Hop

For this game, we will need number cards from 1 to 10 spread out on the floor. You can make these cards easily with paper and a marker.

How to Play:
- A teacher or parent will play some music and stop it at random times.
- When the music stops, children should hop onto the nearest number card.
- Ask each child which number they are standing on.
- Repeat the game and encourage children to stand on a different number each time.

This game reinforces number recognition in a fun, physical way.

#### 2. Number Fishing

Create a small fishing rod with a magnet attached to the string, and make fish shapes with paper clips on them and number them 1 to 10.

How to Play:
- Spread the fish out on the floor or in a makeshift pond.
- Let children take turns "fishing" for a number.
- When a child catches a fish, they must say the number on the fish.
- Keep going until all the fish are caught and all numbers from 1 to 10 are called out.

#### Answers to the Exercises:

Since the singing and games involve active participation and are not in a written format, there are no specific answers provided here. However, for both the counting song and “Five Little Ducks,” parents and teachers should encourage the children to sing the numbers in order and correctly. In the “Number Hop” and “Number Fishing” games, children should be able to identify the number they have landed on or caught. Correct identification by the child confirms understanding.

Through these songs and games, children practice counting, learn number identification, and gain a sense of the number sequence, all essential skills for developing math literacy at a young age. Enjoy the learning journey with tunes and laughter!
