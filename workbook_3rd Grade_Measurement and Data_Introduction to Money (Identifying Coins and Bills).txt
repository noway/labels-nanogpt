# Introduction to Money (Identifying Coins and Bills)

Welcome to the exciting world of money! In this section, we are going to learn how to recognize and count different types of coins and bills that you might see in everyday life. Understanding money is very important – it helps us buy things that we need or want, and knowing about it can also be quite fun!

**Coins**

Coins are small metal pieces that come in different sizes and values. In the United States, there are four main coins that you will need to know about:

1. **Penny** – The penny is worth 1 cent. It's the smallest value of all the coins. Pennies are made of copper and have Abraham Lincoln's face on one side, and the Lincoln Memorial on the other.

2. **Nickel** – The nickel is worth 5 cents. Nickels are a bit larger than pennies and have Thomas Jefferson's face on one side and Monticello, his home, on the other side.

3. **Dime** – The dime is worth 10 cents. Dimes are the smallest in size of the coins but worth more than pennies and nickels. On one side of the dime is Franklin D. Roosevelt's face, and on the other is a torch, olive branch, and oak branch.

4. **Quarter** – The quarter is worth 25 cents. Quarters are larger than nickels and dimes and have George Washington's face on one side. On the other side, they often show a special design or a state park, known as the "America the Beautiful" quarters series.

**Bills**

Bills are paper money and come in several values:

1. **One Dollar Bill ($1)** – It has the face of George Washington.

2. **Five Dollar Bill ($5)** – It has the face of Abraham Lincoln.

3. **Ten Dollar Bill ($10)** – It has the face of Alexander Hamilton.

4. **Twenty Dollar Bill ($20)** – It has the face of Andrew Jackson.

5. **Fifty Dollar Bill ($50)** – It has the face of Ulysses S. Grant.

6. **One Hundred Dollar Bill ($100)** – It has the face of Benjamin Franklin.

**Counting Money**

To count money, you start by adding up the coins and bills separately and then combining the totals. Always start with the bills or coins of the highest value to make the counting easier. 

**Exercises**

Let's practice what you've learned! Count the following sets of coins and bills and write down the total amount of money.

1. Exercise 1: 3 Quarters, 4 Dimes, 2 Nickels, and 5 Pennies
2. Exercise 2: 2 One Dollar Bills, 1 Five Dollar Bills, and 3 Ten Dollar Bills
3. Exercise 3: 1 Fifty Dollar Bill, 2 Twenty Dollar Bills, 1 One Dollar Bill, and 2 Quarters

**Answers:**

1. Exercise 1: 3 Quarters ($0.75), 4 Dimes ($0.40), 2 Nickels ($0.10), and 5 Pennies ($0.05). So the total is $0.75 + $0.40 + $0.10 + $0.05 = $1.30

2. Exercise 2: 2 One Dollar Bills ($2.00) and 1 Five Dollar Bill ($5.00), and 3 Ten Dollar Bills ($30.00). So the total is $2.00 + $5.00 + $30.00 = $37.00

3. Exercise 3: 1 Fifty Dollar Bill ($50.00), 2 Twenty Dollar Bills ($40.00), 1 One Dollar Bill ($1.00), and 2 Quarters ($0.50). So the total is $50.00 + $40.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $91.50

Great job learning about coins and bills! Remember to practice, and soon you'll be a pro at identifying and counting money.
