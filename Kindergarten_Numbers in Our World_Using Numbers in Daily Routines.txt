# Numbers in Our World

## Using Numbers in Daily Routines

Numbers are everywhere! They help us understand the world around us and are very useful in our everyday activities. Let's explore how we use numbers during our daily routines.

### Counting Steps

Imagine you are walking to your friend’s house. How many steps does it take to get there? By counting each step, you're using numbers! Let’s practice:

**Exercise 1:** Take ten steps and count each one out loud.

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10!

Great job! Now you know you can take ten steps.

### Telling Time

Clocks use numbers to tell us the time. Do you see how the clock has numbers from 1 to 12? These numbers help us know what time it is during the day.

**Exercise 2:** Look at a clock and find the little hand. What number is it pointing to? That’s the hour!

If the little hand is pointing to 3, it means it is three o'clock!

### Playing Games

Numbers are also in games. When we roll a dice or spin a spinner, we are using numbers to know how many spaces to move in the game.

**Exercise 3:** Roll a dice and count the dots on the top side. How many are there?

If you see 4 dots, you can move 4 spaces in the game. 

### Setting the Table

When we set the table for dinner, we count how many plates, forks, spoons, and cups we need.

**Exercise 4:** If you have 4 people in your family, how many plates do we need?

That’s right, 4 plates!

### Sorting Shapes

Shapes may have numbers too! They have sides and corners, and we can count them.

**Exercise 5:** Draw a square. How many sides does it have? How many corners?

A square has 4 sides and 4 corners.

### Sharing Snacks

When you have a bag of snacks and want to share with your friends, you use numbers to divide the snacks equally.

**Exercise 6:** You have 10 crackers and 2 friends. How many crackers does each person get?

Each person gets 3 crackers and you get 4 crackers. Everyone has a snack, and no one is left out!

### Planting a Garden

If you help plant a garden, you use numbers to count how many seeds to plant and to measure the space between them.

**Exercise 7:** You want to plant 3 rows of flowers. How many seeds do you put in each row if you have 9 seeds?

You can plant 3 seeds in each row. 3 rows x 3 seeds = 9 seeds.

### Measuring Ingredients

When we cook or bake, we follow recipes that tell us how much of each ingredient to use. We measure and count cups and spoons.

**Exercise 8:** A cookie recipe asks for 2 cups of flour. Fill up a 1-cup measuring cup two times to get 2 cups.

1 cup + 1 cup = 2 cups of flour.

### Answers to Exercises:

**Exercise 1:** Counting should lead to a number "10."
**Exercise 2:** The answer depends on the current time when looking at the clock.
**Exercise 3:** The answer ranges from 1 to 6, depending on the result of the dice roll.
**Exercise 4:** You need 4 plates.
**Exercise 5:** A square has 4 sides and 4 corners.
**Exercise 6:** Each friend gets 3 crackers, and you get 4.
**Exercise 7:** You can plant 3 seeds in each row.
**Exercise 8:** You need to measure out 2 cups of flour.

Remember, numbers help us with lots of things we do every day. Keep practicing, and you'll see how numbers can be fun and useful!
