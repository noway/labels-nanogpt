# Introduction to Addition

## Welcome to Basic Addition!

Hello young mathematician! Welcome to the magical world of numbers. Today, we are going to explore a very important part of math called addition. Addition helps us find out how many things we have altogether when we put groups of things together. It’s like when you have some cookies and your friend gives you some more – you get to figure out the total number of cookies you can enjoy! Isn’t that exciting? Let's start our fun journey into addition!

## What is Addition?

Addition is one of the first and most important mathematical operations that you will learn. When you add, you are putting numbers together to see what they total. The symbol that we use for addition is the plus sign (+). When we add two or more numbers, the answer we get is called the "sum."

For example, if you have 1 red balloon and you get 2 more red balloons, you have 1 + 2 red balloons in total. To find out how many that is, we add the numbers together like this:

1 red balloon + 2 red balloons = 3 red balloons

## Let's Practice Adding!

Great! Now that we understand what addition is, let’s try a few problems. Don't worry, I'm here to help you and I'll give you the answers too, so you can check your work!

### Exercise 1:

**Question:** If there are 2 apples on the table and you put 3 more apples on the table, how many apples are there in total?

**Answer:** 2 apples + 3 apples = 5 apples

### Exercise 2:

**Question:** You have 4 crayons and your friend gives you 1 more crayon. How many crayons do you have now?

**Answer:** 4 crayons + 1 crayon = 5 crayons

### Exercise 3:

**Question:** There are 3 birds sitting on a tree. 2 more birds join them. How many birds are sitting on the tree now?

**Answer:** 3 birds + 2 birds = 5 birds

## Using Objects to Add

You don’t always need to use numbers to add; you can use objects like counters, blocks, or even your fingers. Adding with objects can help you understand how addition works and make it easier to remember.

### Practice with Objects

**Question:** You have 2 toy cars and your brother gives you 1 more toy car. Let's use blocks to find out how many cars you have altogether.

**Answer:** 2 toy cars (2 blocks) + 1 toy car (1 block) = 3 toy cars (3 blocks)

## Addition Words to Know

When learning addition, there are some special words we use:

- **Addend:** The numbers we are adding. In 2 + 3, the numbers 2 and 3 are the addends.
- **Plus Sign (+):** The symbol we use to show addition.
- **Sum:** The result of adding two or more numbers. In 2 + 3 = 5, the number 5 is the sum.

## Symbols in Addition

When we write down addition problems, we use symbols and numbers. It looks like this:

**Example:** 1 + 2 = 3

The '+' symbol tells us to add the numbers, and the '=' symbol tells us that what comes next is the sum or total.

## Remember This!

Addition is just putting together. You can add numbers, objects, days, people—almost anything! Plus, the more you practice, the better you'll become at it. Practice helps your brain remember how to add quickly and easily.

Congratulations on completing the "Introduction to Addition" section. Keep practicing these addition problems, and soon you'll become a pro! Remember to check your work with the answers provided and have fun adding!
