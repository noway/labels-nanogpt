# Subtraction with Borrowing

### Introduction

Subtraction is one of the four basic arithmetic operations. It is essentially the opposite of addition. When we subtract, we are finding out how much one number is less than another. Sometimes when we subtract, we need to "borrow" from a neighboring digit. This section will teach you how to subtract numbers that require borrowing.

### When Do We Borrow?

We borrow in subtraction when the digit on top (in the minuend) is smaller than the digit on the bottom (in the subtrahend). When this happens, we can't subtract the bottom digit from the top digit without going into negative numbers, which we want to avoid in basic subtraction. To fix this, we borrow from the next higher place value on the left.

### Steps to Subtract with Borrowing

Let’s follow these steps to perform subtraction with borrowing:

**1.** Write the numbers one below the other, aligning the digits with their place values.

**2.** Start with the rightmost place value (ones).

**3.** If the digit on top is larger than or equal to the bottom digit, subtract as usual.

**4.** If the digit on top is smaller, go to the next left place value and borrow 1. Remember that borrowing 1 is equivalent to borrowing 10 of the lower place value. (For example, borrowing 1 from the tens place value means you borrow 10 ones.)

**5.** Subtract the top digit from the bottom digit (including what you just borrowed) and write down the result.

**6.** Move to the next left place value and repeat the process as needed.

### Example Exercises

**Example 1: Simple Borrowing**

Subtract 45 from 72.

```
  7 2
- 4 5
____
```

We start with the rightmost digits. We cannot subtract 5 from 2, so we need to borrow.

```
  (6)12 (we crossed out 7 and borrowed 10 from it, so it becomes 6)
-  4 5
____
```

Now we can subtract the ones place:

```
  6 (12)
- 4  5
____
     7
```

Move to the tens place and subtract:

```
  6
- 4
____
  2
```

The final answer is 27.

**Example 2: Multiple Borrowing**

Subtract 367 from 805.

```
  8  0  5
- 3  6  7
_______
```

We start with the rightmost digits again. We cannot subtract 7 from 5, so we need to borrow. But there is a 0 in the tens place, so we must borrow from the hundreds place.

```
  7 10  5 
- 3  6  7
_______
```

Now we have a 10 in the tens place, but we still can’t subtract 6 from 10 without borrowing for the ones place.

```
  7 (9)(15)
- 3  6   7
_______
         8
```

Subtract the tens:

```
  7 (9)
- 3  6
_______
  3
```

Finally, subtract the hundreds:

```
  7
- 3
_______
  4
```

The final answer is 438.

### Exercises

Now it's your turn to practice subtraction with borrowing. Subtract the following pairs of numbers:

1. 54 - 29 = ?
2. 123 - 57 = ?
3. 1001 - 568 = ?
4. 86 - 48 = ?
5. 902 - 394 = ?
   
### Answers

Let's look at the answers for the exercises:

1. 54 - 29 = 25
2. 123 - 57 = 66
3. 1001 - 568 = 433
4. 86 - 48 = 38
5. 902 - 394 = 508

Remember to practice borrowing carefully and check your work. With these steps in mind, you’ll be able to tackle any subtraction problem that comes your way!
