## Comparing and Ordering Fractions

Welcome to the section on Comparing and Ordering Fractions! Fractions can sometimes be tricky, but with a little practice, you’ll be a pro in no time. Let's get started and make sure to follow along with each example and try the exercises yourself!

### What is a Fraction?

Before we begin, let’s remember that a fraction represents a part of a whole. It has two parts: a numerator (the top number) and a denominator (the bottom number). The numerator tells us how many parts we have, and the denominator tells us into how many parts the whole is divided.

### Comparing Fractions

To compare fractions means to determine which fraction is larger or if they are equal. There are several ways to compare fractions:

#### Same Denominators

When fractions have the same denominator, we only need to look at the numerators. The fraction with the larger numerator is the larger fraction.

**Example:**
Compare 3/8 and 5/8.

*Solution*: They have the same denominator. Since 5 is greater than 3, 5/8 is larger than 3/8.

#### Same Numerators

When fractions have the same numerator, the fraction with the smaller denominator is the larger fraction.

**Example:**
Compare 4/5 and 4/7.

*Solution*: They have the same numerator. Since 5 is less than 7, 4/5 is larger than 4/7.

#### Different Numerators and Denominators

When fractions have different numerators and denominators, we need a common denominator to compare them.

**Example:**
Compare 2/3 and 3/4.

*Solution*: Find a common denominator, which in this case is 12. Convert each fraction.

2/3 = 8/12 (because 2 × 4 = 8 and 3 × 4 = 12)
3/4 = 9/12 (because 3 × 3 = 9 and 4 × 3 = 12)

Since 9/12 is greater than 8/12, 3/4 is larger than 2/3.

### Exercises: Comparing Fractions

1. Compare 5/6 and 2/6.
2. Compare 3/9 and 3/7.
3. Compare 4/7 and 6/8.

**Answers:**

1. 5/6 is larger than 2/6.
2. 3/7 is larger than 3/9.
3. To compare 4/7 and 6/8, find a common denominator:  
4/7 = 32/56 (because 4 × 8 = 32 and 7 × 8 = 56)  
6/8 = 42/56 (because 6 × 7 = 42 and 8 × 7 = 56)  
Since 42/56 is greater than 32/56, 6/8 is larger than 4/7.

### Ordering Fractions

Ordering fractions involves arranging them from smallest to largest (or largest to smallest). We use the same strategies we used for comparing fractions to put them in order.

#### Example:

Order the fractions from smallest to largest: 1/3, 4/6, and 2/5.

1. Find a common denominator. Let's use 30, as it's a multiple of 3, 6, and 5.
2. Convert each fraction:

1/3 = 10/30 (because 1 × 10 = 10 and 3 × 10 = 30)  
4/6 = 20/30 (because 4 × 5 = 20 and 6 × 5 = 30)  
2/5 = 12/30 (because 2 × 6 = 12 and 5 × 6 = 30)

3. Order the converted fractions:

10/30, 12/30, 20/30

4. Translate back to the original fractions:

1/3, 2/5, 4/6

So, the order from smallest to largest is: 1/3, 2/5, 4/6.

### Exercises: Ordering Fractions

1. Order the fractions from largest to smallest: 2/3, 1/4, and 5/6.
2. Order the fractions from smallest to largest: 3/8, 1/2, and 2/3.

**Answers:**

1. The common denominator for 2/3, 1/4, and 5/6 is 12.  
2/3 = 8/12  
1/4 = 3/12  
5/6 = 10/12  
So the order from largest to smallest is: 5/6, 2/3, 1/4.

2. The common denominator for 3/8, 1/2, and 2/3 is 24.  
3/8 = 9/24  
1/2 = 12/24  
2/3 = 16/24  
So the order from smallest to largest is: 3/8, 1/2, 2/3.

Great job! Remember, practice makes perfect. Keep working on comparing and ordering fractions and you’ll soon be doing it like a pro!
