# Reviewing What We Learned

As we come to the end of our exciting math journey, it's important to look back and review all the amazing things we have learned. This will help us remember how to use our new math skills in everyday life! Let's revisit each topic with fun examples and practice problems.

## Counting and Numbers

You learned to count from 1 to 100! Counting is the foundation of all math skills.

**Example:** Count the number of apples on the table.

**Exercise:** There are 4 red apples and 3 green apples. How many apples are there in total?  
**Answer:** 7 apples (4 red + 3 green = 7)

## Shapes and Sizes

We discovered many shapes and learned to compare sizes. Shapes can be everywhere â€“ in our toys, books, and even our cookies!

**Example:** Find a circle, square, and triangle in your room.

**Exercise:** Which is larger, a soccer ball or a coin?  
**Answer:** A soccer ball is larger.

## Adding Numbers

Adding is simply putting together numbers to find out how many things you have in total.

**Example:** You have 2 balloons, and you get 3 more. How many balloons do you have now?  
**Exercise:** 2 + 3 = ?  
**Answer:** 5 balloons

## Subtracting Numbers

Subtracting is when you take away some things to see what's left.

**Example:** There are 6 cupcakes, and you eat 2. How many are left?  
**Exercise:** 6 - 2 = ?  
**Answer:** 4 cupcakes

## Patterns

Finding patterns is like playing a game where you guess what comes next based on what has happened before.

**Example:** Red, blue, red, blue. What color will be next?  
**Exercise:** Red, red, blue, red, red, ?  
**Answer:** Blue

## Sorting and Classifying

Sorting is when you group things based on their color, shape, or size.

**Example:** Put all the blue blocks in one pile and all the red blocks in another pile.

**Exercise:** If you have 3 small balls and 2 big balls, how many balls do you have in total?  
**Answer:** 5 balls in total (3 small + 2 big = 5)

## Comparing Numbers

We learned how to compare numbers to see which one is more, less, or if they are the same.

**Example:** Which number is bigger: 7 or 3?  
**Exercise:** Circle the bigger number: 4 or 6.  
**Answer:** 6 is bigger.

## Measurement

We looked at how to measure things using non-standard units, like paperclips or blocks.

**Example:** How many paperclips long is your pencil?

**Exercise:** If your book is 5 blocks long and your pen is 3 blocks long, which is longer?  
**Answer:** The book is longer.

## Time

Telling time helps us know when to do things, like going to bed or getting ready for school.

**Example:** We learned how the clock has a big hand for minutes and a small hand for hours.

**Exercise:** What time is it when the big hand is on the 12 and the small hand is on the 1?  
**Answer:** It's 1 o'clock.

## Money

We played store and learned the names and values of coins and bills to buy and sell things.

**Example:** You know that 4 quarters make a dollar.

**Exercise:** If you have 2 dimes and 1 nickel, how many cents do you have?  
**Answer:** 25 cents (2 dimes are 20 cents + 1 nickel is 5 cents = 25 cents)

## Practice Test

Great job reviewing! Now, let's do a quick practice test to make sure we remember everything well.

1. Count the number of birds on the fence: 1, __, 3, 4, 5  
**Answer:** 2

2. Add these numbers: 3 + 4 = ?  
**Answer:** 7

3. Subtract: 8 - 5 = ?  
**Answer:** 3

4. What comes next in the pattern? Triangle, circle, triangle, __  
**Answer:** Circle

5. Which is heavier, a backpack or a pencil?  
**Answer:** A backpack

Keep practicing these exercises, and don't forget to use your new math skills in real life too! Good luck, and have fun with math!
