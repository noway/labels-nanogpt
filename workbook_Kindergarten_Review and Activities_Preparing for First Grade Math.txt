Preparing for First Grade Math

As a kindergartner preparing for first grade, itâ€™s essential to have a good foundation in basic math skills. This section reviews key concepts and provides activities that reinforce learning in a fun way. Remember to work through each problem carefully and check your work as you go!

**Review Topics:**

- Counting to 100 by ones and tens
- Recognizing numbers 1 through 20
- Writing numbers 1 through 20
- Basic shapes (circle, square, triangle, rectangle)
- Understanding more and less
- Comparing sizes (big/little)
- Simple addition with objects (sums up to 10)
- Simple subtraction with objects (numbers within 10)
- Patterns (AB, ABB, AAB, and ABC patterns)

**Activities:**

1. **Counting Practice:**
   
    Count aloud from 1 to 100 by ones. Then, practice skipping counting by tens (10, 20, 30, ..., 100).
    
    _No written answer needed. Practice until you feel confident!_

2. **Number Recognition:**
   
    Draw a line from each written number to the correct number of objects.

    _Since we can't display images, for this activity, imagine a worksheet where a number (1-20) is written on one side and several sets of objects are on the other._

3. **Writing Numbers:**
   
    Trace and then write the numbers from 1 to 20 on your own.
    
    _Check your written numbers with a number chart or ask an adult if they look right._

4. **Shape Identification:**
   
    Look around your room and draw a picture of one object for each shape (circle, square, triangle, rectangle).

    _Answers will vary depending on the objects selected by the student._

5. **More or Less:**
   
    Circle the group of objects that has more. Draw an X over the group that has fewer objects.
    
    _(Example provided in the book)_

6. **Comparing Sizes:**
   
    Draw a bigger shape around the big object and a smaller shape around the little object in each pair given.
    
    _(Example provided in the book)_

7. **Simple Addition:**
   
    Use objects like buttons or coins to add the numbers given and write the sum.
    
    _Example: 4 buttons + 3 buttons = 7 buttons_

8. **Simple Subtraction:**
   
    Use objects to subtract the smaller number from the bigger number and write the answer.
    
    _Example: 5 blocks - 2 blocks = 3 blocks_

9. **Pattern Recognition:**
   
    Complete the given pattern with drawings or by using stickers.
    
    _Example: Star, Heart, Star, Heart, ___ (Answer: Star)_

**Answers to Activities:**

2. Number Recognition: Since we cannot display actual images, please check with a reference chart provided in the workbook.

3. Writing Numbers: Confirm the number shapes with an adult or compare to printed numbers in the workbook.

4. Shape Identification: Answers will be unique; check that the shapes drawn match the names.

5. More or Less: For example, if there are 5 apples and 3 bananas, you would circle the apples and put an X over the bananas.

6. Comparing Sizes: Validate your answers with someone or compare them with pictures in the book.

7. Simple Addition: Check your answer by counting the objects after combining both sets.

8. Simple Subtraction: Verify your answer by removing the subtracted number of objects and counting what remains.

9. Pattern Recognition: The completed pattern should maintain the sequence. For AB patterns, if it starts with an apple (A) and banana (B), the next item in the sequence should be an apple.

Remember to ask for help if you need it, and practice makes perfect. Keep working on these exercises, and you'll be ready for first grade in no time! Good luck!
