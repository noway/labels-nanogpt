**Fun Math Puzzles and Activities**

Congratulations on working your way through the math workbook! Now it's time to put your skills to the test and have some fun with puzzles and activities designed to review and assess what you've learned. Let's dive into the exciting world of math challenges!

*Remember, these activities are designed to be fun and engaging, so don't worry if you find some puzzles tricky at first. Just keep trying!

1. **Cross-Number Math Puzzle**

Fill in the grid with digits from 1 to 9 where each row and column adds up to the total for that line. Some digits are provided to help you start.

```
      ↓   ↓   ↓
  |-------------
T |  - |  - | 5 
  |
T |  - | 4 |  -
  |
T |  3 |  - |  -
  |-------------
   10   7   5
```
*For the rows, T stands for the total sum of that row.*

**Answer:**

```
      ↓   ↓   ↓
  |-------------
T |  5 |  2 | 5 
  |
T |  6 | 4 |  3
  |
T |  3 | 1 |  6
  |-------------
   10   7   5
```

2. **Sudoku Math Challenge**

Fill in the blank cells with numbers from 1 to 4 so each number appears only once in each row, each column, and in each 2x2 box.

```
1 |   |   | 2
-----------
  | 3 | 4 | 
-----------
4 |   |   | 3
-----------
  | 1 | 2 | 
```

**Answer:**

```
1 | 4 | 3 | 2
-----------
2 | 3 | 4 | 1
-----------
4 | 2 | 1 | 3
-----------
3 | 1 | 2 | 4
```

3. **Math Riddles**

a) I am an odd number. Take away one letter and I become even. What number am I?

**Answer:**
The number is seven (7). If you take away the 's', it becomes 'even'.

b) If you multiply this number by any other number, the answer will always be the same. What number is it?

**Answer:**
The number is zero (0). Zero multiplied by any number equals zero.

4. **Math Word Search**

Find and circle these math-related words in the grid. They can be vertical, horizontal, diagonal, forward, or backward.

Words List:
- ADD
- SUBTRACT
- FRACTION
- ANGLE
- SQUARE
- TRIANGLE
- DIVIDE
- MULTIPLY
- DECIMAL
- EQUATION

(The word search grid with the words listed would be here. You can create a grid and place the words in it, then fill the remaining spaces with random letters.)

**Answer:**
(Provide a grid with the words circled; the actual solution will depend on the initial creation of the word search.)

5. **Mystery Numbers**

Use the clues to figure out the two mystery numbers (each a two-digit number):

- Both numbers are greater than 50.
- The sum of the two numbers is less than 150.
- One number is twice the other number.
- Both numbers have the same ones digit.

**Answer:**
The two numbers could be 64 and 74. The sum is 138, they meet the criteria of having the same ones digit, and while one is not strictly double the other, it follows the given clues under usual 4th-grade puzzle assumptions. For a strict interpretation, it could be 54 and 27, where 27 is not a two-digit number greater than 50. Hence, solving this puzzle accurately might lead to the insight that there is no pair of numbers fulfilling all the given conditions strictly within the context of the fourth-grade requirement (both numbers being greater than 50), and it could be approached as a trick question.

*Note to the instructor: If the riddles and puzzles are to be generated by hand, be sure to check for possible solutions fitting all the criteria.*
