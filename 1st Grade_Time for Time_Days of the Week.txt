## Time for Time: Days of the Week

Hello, young mathematicians! Today, we’re going to learn about the days of the week. There are seven days in every week. Each day is special because it has its own name!

### The Days of the Week

Can you say the days of the week with me? Let's say them in order, starting with the day when many of us relax at home or have a day off from school, and ending with the day right before it:

1. Sunday
2. Monday
3. Tuesday
4. Wednesday
5. Thursday
6. Friday
6. Saturday

Here's an easy way to remember them:
"Silly Monkeys Try Walking Through Forests Silently."

Now let's practice saying the days of the week together. Ready? Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Great job!
