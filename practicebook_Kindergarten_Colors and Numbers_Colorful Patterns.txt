# Colors and Numbers Chapter

### Section: Colorful Patterns

Welcome little learners to the "Colorful Patterns" section of your Math Practice Book! Here, we'll play with colors and numbers to create beautiful patterns and sequences. Patterns are all around us! They help us predict what comes next in a sequence, which is an important skill in math and in our daily lives. So let's have some fun!

#### Activity 1: What Comes Next?

In this activity, you will look at a sequence of colors and figure out which color should come next. Use your crayons to color in the correct answer!

1. Red, Blue, Red, Blue, Red, __?
    - Answer: Blue (color the next circle blue)
   
2. Green, Yellow, Green, Yellow, Green, __?
    - Answer: Yellow (color the next circle yellow)
   
3. Purple, Purple, Orange, Purple, Purple, __?
    - Answer: Orange (color the next circle orange)

4. Brown, Brown, Brown, Blue, __?, __?
    - Answers: Blue, Blue (color the next two circles blue)

#### Activity 2: Create Your Own Pattern

Now it's your turn to make a pattern! Use at least three different colors. Draw a pattern of circles and color them in. Then, show your pattern to a friend or family member and see if they can guess what comes next!

For example: Pink, Pink, Green, Pink, Pink, Green, __?
- Answer: Pink (your friend should color the next circle pink)

#### Activity 3: Number Patterns

First, we'll color the numbers in a pattern. Then, count the number of each color used in the pattern.

1. Color the numbers following this pattern: 1 (Red), 2 (Blue), 3 (Blue), 4 (Red), 5 (Blue), 6 (Blue), __?, __?
    - Answers: 7 (Red), 8 (Blue)
    - Count of Red: 2
    - Count of Blue: 4
   
2. Now create your own number pattern with three colors. Write numbers 1 through 10 and color them in your pattern. Count how many of each color you used and write it down.

Example: Your Pattern might be 1 (Green), 2 (Yellow), 3 (Yellow), 4 (Green), 5 (Green), 6 (Yellow), 7 (Yellow), 8 (Green), 9 (Green), 10 (Yellow):
- Count of Green: 4
- Count of Yellow: 6

#### Activity 4: Missing Color in the Sequence

Oh no! A color is missing in the pattern. Can you find out which one it is and color it in?

1. Orange, __?, Orange, Blue, Orange, Blue, Orange
    - Answer: Blue (color the blank space with blue)

2. Yellow, Green, __?, Green, Yellow, Green, Yellow
    - Answer: Green (color the blank space with green)

3. __?, Pink, Pink, Gray, Pink, Gray, Pink
    - Answer: Pink (color the blank space with pink)

#### Activity 5: Pattern Challenge

We have a challenge for you! These patterns are a bit trickier. Can you figure them out?

1. Red, Yellow, Yellow, Green, Red, __?, __?, Green
    - Answers: Yellow, Yellow (color the circles in order: yellow, yellow)

2. Blue, Blue, Purple, Purple, Blue, __?, __?, Purple
    - Answers: Blue, Purple (color the circles in order: blue, purple)

Congratulations on completing the "Colorful Patterns" section! You practiced recognizing and creating patterns using colors and numbers. Patterns help us predict and understand the world. Keep practicing and you'll be a pattern master in no time!

Remember that practice makes perfect, little learners, so feel free to revisit these activities anytime!
