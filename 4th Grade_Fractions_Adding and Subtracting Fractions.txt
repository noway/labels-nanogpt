## Adding and Subtracting Fractions

### Introduction to Fractions

Before we begin adding and subtracting fractions, let's remind ourselves what a fraction is. A fraction represents a part of a whole. It has two parts: the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is the number above the line, which tells us how many parts we have. The denominator is the number below the line, which tells us into how many parts the whole is divided.

### Adding Fractions

To add fractions, there are a few simple rules we need to follow:

#### Same Denominator

When the fractions have the same denominator (the bottom number), you only need to add the numerators (the top numbers).

**Example 1:**

`1/4 + 1/4`

Both fractions have the same denominator, which is 4. So, we add the numerators:

`1 + 1 = 2`

The answer is:

`1/4 + 1/4 = 2/4`

But we're not done! We always want to check if our fraction can be simplified (this means making the fraction as simple as possible).

`2/4 = 1/2` because 2 is a common factor of both 2 and 4.

**Exercise 1:**

Try adding these fractions and then simplify them if you can.

a) `3/8 + 1/8`

b) `5/6 + 1/6`

**Answers:**

a) `3/8 + 1/8 = 4/8` which simplifies to `1/2`

b) `5/6 + 1/6 = 6/6` which is also equal to `1` because it represents a whole.

#### Different Denominator

When the fractions have different denominators, we need to find a common denominator before we can add them:

1. Find the least common denominator (LCD), which is the smallest number that both denominators can divide into evenly.
2. Change each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCD.
3. Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.
4. Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.

**Example 2:**

`1/3 + 1/4`

The LCD for 3 and 4 is 12, so we convert the fractions:

`1/3 = 4/12` (we multiplied both the numerator and the denominator by 4)

`1/4 = 3/12` (we multiplied both the numerator and the denominator by 3)

Now, we can add them:

`4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12`

The answer is `7/12`, and it cannot be simplified further.

**Exercise 2:**

Convert these fractions to have a common denominator and then add them.

a) `2/5 + 1/10`

b) `3/7 + 2/14`

**Answers:**

a) `2/5 + 1/10` find the LCD which is 10, `2/5 = 4/10`, so `4/10 + 1/10 = 5/10` which simplifies to `1/2`

b) `3/7 + 2/14` find the LCD which is 14, `3/7 = 6/14`, so `6/14 + 2/14 = 8/14` which simplifies to `4/7`

### Subtracting Fractions

Subtracting fractions works very similarly to adding fractions.

#### Same Denominator

When the denominators are the same, subtract the numerators and write the result over the same denominator.

**Example 3:**

`3/5 - 2/5`

Subtract the numerators:

`3 - 2 = 1`

So:

`3/5 - 2/5 = 1/5`

**Exercise 3:**

Try subtracting these fractions.

a) `7/9 - 2/9`

b) `5/8 - 3/8`

**Answers:**

a) `7/9 - 2/9 = 5/9`

b) `5/8 - 3/8 = 2/8` which can be simplified to `1/4`

#### Different Denominator

When the denominators are different, we must find a common denominator before subtracting.

**Example 4:**

`5/6 - 1/3`

Find the LCD, which is 6 for 6 and 3:

`1/3 = 2/6` (multiply by 2)

Now we can subtract:

`5/6 - 2/6 = 3/6`

`3/6` simplifies to `1/2`.

**Exercise 4:**

Find the common denominators and subtract these fractions.

a) `3/4 - 1/8`

b) `5/7 - 2/14`

**Answers:**

a) `3/4 - 1/8`, the LCD is 8, `3/4 = 6/8`, so `6/8 - 1/8 = 5/8`

b) `5/7 - 2/14`, the LCD is 14, `5/7 = 10/14`, so `10/14 - 2/14 = 8/14` which simplifies to `4/7`

### Practice Problems

Now that you know how to add and subtract fractions with the same and different denominators, try these problems on your own!

1. `2/3 + 1/6`

2. `7/8 - 3/8`

3. `1/2 + 3/5`

4. `4/9 - 2/3`

5. `5/12 + 1/4`

### Answers to Practice Problems

1. `2/3 + 1/6`, LCD is 6, `2/3 = 4/6`, so `4/6 + 1/6 = 5/6`

2. `7/8 - 3/8 = 4/8`, which simplifies to `1/2`

3. `1/2 + 3/5`, LCD is 10, `1/2 = 5/10`, `3/5 = 6/10`, so `5/10 + 6/10 = 11/10`

4. `4/9 - 2/3`, LCD is 9, `2/3 = 6/9`, so `4/9 - 6/9 = -2/9` (Note: This is a negative fraction because we are taking away more than we have.)

5. `5/12 + 1/4`, LCD is 12, `1/4 = 3/12`, so `5/12 + 3/12 = 8/12`, which simplifies to `2/3`

Congratulations! You have now learned how to add and subtract fractions. With practice, you will be able to do these calculations quickly and easily.
