## Understanding Decimals

### What Are Decimals?

Welcome to the section on Understanding Decimals! Decimals are a way of representing fractions and mixed numbers in a different form. They use the base-ten system, which is the same system we use for counting whole numbers.

In the base-ten system, each place to the left or right of the decimal point has a value that is ten times bigger or smaller than the one next to it. The decimal point helps us to separate the whole number part from the fractional part.

### Places in Decimal Numbers

Let's look at the places in a decimal number:

- The first place to the right of the decimal point is the tenths place.
- The second place to the right is the hundredths place.
- The third place to the right is the thousandths place.
- And it goes on â€“ ten-thousandths, hundred-thousandths, etc.

For example, the decimal 0.8 stands for 8 tenths, or 8/10 when written as a fraction.

### Writing Decimals

It is important to know how to read and write decimals correctly. If you have a number like 3.467, it's read as "three and four hundred sixty-seven thousandths." Notice how the last word indicates the last place value of the decimal.

### Comparing Decimals

To compare decimals, you start with the largest place value and move to the right. For example, to compare 0.56 and 0.6, you look at the tenths place first. Since 6 is greater than 5, then 0.6 is greater than 0.56.

### Rounding Decimals

Rounding decimals is just like rounding whole numbers. If you are rounding to the nearest tenth, you look at the hundredths place to see if it is 5 or more to round up, or 4 or less to keep the tenths place the same.

For example, to round 3.746 to the nearest tenth:
- The hundredths place is a 4, which is less than 5, so the tenths place stays the same.
- Rounding 3.746 to the nearest tenth gives us 3.7.

### Exercises

1. **Write the decimal and fraction for each place value:**
   - 3 tenths
   - 14 hundredths
   - 256 thousandths

2. **Compare the decimals:**
   - 0.75 and 0.7
   - 0.62 and 0.601
   - 0.39 and 0.389

3. **Round the following decimals to the nearest tenth:**
   - 0.34
   - 2.85
   - 0.761

### Answers

1. **Write the decimal and fraction for each place value:**
   - 3 tenths = 0.3 = 3/10
   - 14 hundredths = 0.14 = 14/100
   - 256 thousandths = 0.256 = 256/1000

2. **Compare the decimals:**
   - 0.75 is greater than 0.7 because 5 in the hundredths place is greater than 0.
   - 0.62 is greater than 0.601 because 2 in the hundredths place is greater than 0, even though 1 is in the thousandths place.
   - 0.39 is greater than 0.389 because 0 in the thousandths place is less than 9.

3. **Round the following decimals to the nearest tenth:**
   - 0.34 rounds down to 0.3 because 4 in the hundredths place is less than 5.
   - 2.85 rounds up to 2.9 because 5 in the hundredths place is 5 or more.
   - 0.761 rounds up to 0.8 because 6 in the hundredths place is 5 or more.

Remember, understanding decimals is all about practice. Keep working through examples and exercises to become more comfortable with decimals!
