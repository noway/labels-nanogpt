# Understanding Numbers

## Number Shapes and Patterns

Welcome to the "Number Shapes and Patterns" section of our 1st Grade math workbook! In this part, we will explore different ways we can see numbers in shapes and patterns. Understanding these can help you recognize numbers all around you and see how they fit together in fun and interesting ways.

### Exercise 1: Counting Shapes

Look at the shapes below and count the number of sides each one has. Write the number inside the shape.

1. Triangle
2. Square
3. Rectangle
4. Pentagon
5. Hexagon
6. Octagon

**Answers:**
1. Triangle: 3 sides
2. Square: 4 sides
3. Rectangle: 4 sides
4. Pentagon: 5 sides
5. Hexagon: 6 sides
6. Octagon: 8 sides

### Exercise 2: Drawing Number Shapes

Now it's your turn to draw! Draw the shapes with the correct number of sides based on the number given.

1. Draw a shape with 4 sides.
2. Draw a shape with 6 sides.
3. Draw a shape with 8 sides.

**Answers:**
1. This could be a square or a rectangle as both have 4 sides.
2. You should have drawn a hexagon, which has 6 sides.
3. An octagon is the shape with 8 sides, just like the stop sign!

### Exercise 3: Number Patterns

Look at these number patterns. Can you tell what number comes next?

1. 2, 4, 6, 8, ____
2. 5, 10, 15, 20, ____
3. 3, 6, 9, 12, ____

Write the next number in the pattern.

**Answers:**
1. The next number is 10. We are adding 2 each time.
2. The next number is 25. We are adding 5 each time.
3. The next number is 15. We are adding 3 each time.

### Exercise 4: Completing the Shape Pattern

Finish these shape patterns:

1. Triangle, square, triangle, square, ____
2. Circle, triangle, circle, triangle, ____
3. Hexagon, pentagon, hexagon, pentagon, ____

What shape comes next? Draw it in the pattern.

**Answers:**
1. Square. We are alternating between triangles and squares.
2. Triangle. The pattern alternates between circles and triangles.
3. Pentagon. The pattern alternates between hexagons and pentagons.

### Exercise 5: Creating Your Own Patterns

Now it’s your turn to be creative! Create your own pattern using numbers or shapes. Make sure there is a rule to your pattern, and after you've made it, explain your rule.

**Answers:**
Your pattern and rule will be unique. Here’s an example of a student's pattern with the rule:
Pattern: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
Rule: Add 2 to get to the next odd number.

Remember, there’s no one correct answer for this exercise. Be creative and have fun with numbers and shapes!
