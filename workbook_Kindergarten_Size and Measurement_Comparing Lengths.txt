# Size and Measurement

## Chapter: Comparing Lengths

In this section, we are going to learn how to compare the lengths of different objects. We will figure out which objects are longer or shorter. Remember, when we compare lengths, we look to see if one thing is more stretched out than another.

### Exercise 1: Longer or Shorter?

Look at the two objects in each question. Circle "LONGER" if the first object is longer than the second. Circle "SHORTER" if the first object is shorter than the second.

1. A pencil and a crayon.
   LONGER ❏   SHORTER ☑️

2. A soccer ball and a basketball.
   LONGER ❏   SHORTER ❏ (Not applicable as these are not "long" objects. They are round!)

3. A school bus and a bicycle.
   LONGER ☑️   SHORTER ❏

4. A worm and a ladybug.
   LONGER ☑️   SHORTER ❏

5. A pair of scissors and a glue stick.
   LONGER ❏   SHORTER ☑️

### Exercise 2: Order from Shortest to Longest

Below are pictures of objects. Draw a line from the shortest object to the number 1, the next shortest to the number 2, and the longest to the number 3.

- A shoe, a sock, and a skateboard.

Answer:
1. Sock
2. Shoe
3. Skateboard

### Exercise 3: Hands-On Measurement

Find three objects in your classroom or home. Use your hand to measure how long they are. Remember to keep your hand still each time you move it. Write down how many hands long each object is.

Example objects:
- A book
- A spoon
- A bed

Answers (note these answers can vary due to the actual sizes of objects and students' hand sizes):

1. Book - 3 hands long
2. Spoon - 1 hand long
3. Bed - 10 hands long 

### Exercise 4: Comparing with Nonstandard Units

Using your pencil as a measuring tool, measure the length of the following items in "pencils." One pencil laid down at a time end to end. Write down how many "pencils" long each item is.

Example items:
- A notebook
- A piece of string
- Your foot

Answers (note these answers can vary due to actual sizes of objects and pencil length):

1. Notebook - 2 pencils long
2. Piece of string - 1 pencil long
3. Your foot - 1 pencil long

Congratulations on completing the "Comparing Lengths" section! You now know how to look at objects and figure out which ones are longer or shorter. You can also order objects from shortest to longest and measure things using nonstandard units like your hand or a pencil. Great job! Keep practicing, and soon you'll be a measuring master!
