### **Section 1.2: Counting Objects in Our Surroundings**

Welcome, young mathematicians! Today, we're going to play a counting game. Counting is a way to find out how many of something there are. We can count our toys, trees, friends, and so many other things! 

When we count, we usually start from the number 1 and go up one number at a time. Let's practice together!

#### **Exercise 1: Counting Toys**

Imagine you have some toys in front of you:

🚗 🐻 🎈 🏀 🐱

Let's count them together.

We start with the first toy, the car:
"One." 

Now move to the teddy bear:
"Two."

Then the balloon:
"Three."

The basketball is next:
"Four."

And finally, the little cat:
"Five."

Great job! We counted all the toys. There are 5 toys in total.

#### **Practice Tip:**
When you count objects, point to each one as you say the number. This helps you keep track and not count anything twice.

#### **Exercise 2: Counting Fruits**

Now, let's count some fruits. Look at these pictures:

🍎 🍌 🍐 🍎 🍇

Let's count them. Point to each one and say the number out loud.

Did you get "Five" again? 

That's right! There are 5 fruits: 2 apples, 1 banana, 1 pear, and 1 grape.

#### **Exercise 3: How Many Are There?**

For this game, we're going to look at different groups of objects. Your task is to count each one and tell how many there are.

#### **Counting Everywhere!**

Remember, you can count anything, anywhere! Next time you are on a walk, try counting:
- The number of birds you see.
- How many trees are on your street.
- Cars that pass by your house.

The more you practice, the better you'll become at counting.

Great job today, mathematicians! Keep practicing, and soon you'll be able to count higher and higher numbers!

### **Homework Challenge**

As a fun homework activity, create your own counting challenge! Find objects around your home or at the park, and count them. You could count:
- The number of steps in your house.
- How many forks and spoons are in your kitchen drawer.
- Dandelions in your yard.

Remember to write down the numbers as you count. Bring your counts to class, and we'll see what everyone found!

Stay curious and happy counting!
