### Project 4: Color By Number

#### What You'll Need:
- A color by number sheet (you can find these in books or print one online).
- A set of crayons or markers

#### Instructions:
1. Look at the guide on your color by number sheet to see which color each number corresponds to.
2. Find all the sections with the same number and color them in with the correct color.
3. Watch as a picture emerges from the numbers!

#### What You'll Learn:
- Number matching
- Patience and attention to detail

### Project 5: Math Bingo

#### What You'll Need:
- Bingo cards with numbers on them (create your own or find a printable online)
- Small objects like beans or buttons to use as markers
- Number cards (1-20)

#### Instructions:
1. Each player gets a bingo card with numbers on it.
2. Draw number cards one by one and call out the number.
3. If a player has that number on their card, they cover it with a marker.
4. The first player to get five in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) calls out "Bingo!" and wins.

#### What You'll Learn:
- Number recognition
- Sequencing and patterns

### Answers:
Since each of these projects is creative and unique to what each student creates, there aren’t specific answers. However, here are some examples of what you might expect:

- **Number Collage:** You might have made a collage with numbers arranged from smallest to largest or created a picture using numbers.
- **Math Storybook:** Your story may have included a problem like "Three butterflies landed on the flower. Two more joined. Now there are five butterflies!" (3 + 2 = 5)
- **Shape Hunt:** You might have found a wheel for a circle, a picture frame for a rectangle, or a slice of pizza for a triangle.
- **Color By Number:** As you color by the given numbers, your completed picture might be a rainbow or an animal.
- **Math Bingo:** No specific answers needed, but if number "16" was called and present on your card, you’d place a marker on it.

Remember, the true answers lie in enjoying the process and learning new math concepts. Have fun with these projects!
