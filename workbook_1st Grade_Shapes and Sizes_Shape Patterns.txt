## Shape Patterns

Welcome to the world of shapes! In this section, you will learn about patterns with shapes. A pattern is a design that repeats over and over. By the end of this section, you will be able to recognize, extend, and create your own shape patterns!

### Identifying Shape Patterns
Let's start by identifying patterns made of shapes. You will see some patterns below. Your job is to look at each pattern and tell which shape comes next.

1. **Example Pattern**: Circle, Square, Circle, Square, Circle, **What comes next?**

   **Answer**: Square. The pattern alternates between a circle and a square, so after the circle, a square comes next.

2. **Example Pattern**: Triangle, Triangle, Square, Triangle, Triangle, Square, Triangle, **What comes next?**

   **Answer**: Triangle. The pattern is two triangles followed by a square.

3. **Example Pattern**: Rectangle, Circle, Rectangle, Circle, Rectangle, **What comes next?**

   **Answer**: Circle. The pattern alternates between a rectangle and a circle.

### Extending Shape Patterns
Now, let's try to extend given patterns. This means you will write out or draw the shapes that follow the given ones to continue the pattern.

1. **Example Pattern** to Extend: Hexagon, Hexagon, Circle, Hexagon, Hexagon, Circle, Hexagon, **Extend it**!

   **Extended Pattern**: Hexagon, Circle. This pattern is two hexagons followed by one circle.

2. **Example Pattern** to Extend: Square, Triangle, Triangle, Square, Triangle, Triangle, **Extend it**!

   **Extended Pattern**: Square, Triangle, Triangle. This pattern shows one square followed by two triangles.

### Creating Shape Patterns
Now that you know how to recognize and extend shape patterns, it's time to get creative and make your own! Look at the shapes you have: circle, square, triangle, rectangle, and hexagon. Create a pattern using at least three of these shapes and repeat the pattern two or three times.

1. **Create Your Pattern Example**: Triangle, Square, Circle, Triangle, Square, Circle, Triangle, **Finish the Pattern**!

   **Your Completed Pattern**: Square, Circle. Your pattern shows a triangle, a square, and then a circle, repeated.

### Practice Problems

Now, try these practice problems. The answers are provided below so you can check your work after you're done.

1. What shape comes next in this pattern?
   
   Pattern: Square, Circle, Triangle, Square, Circle, **What comes next?**

   **Answer**: Triangle. The pattern repeats every three shapes.

2. Extend this pattern by three more shapes.
   
   Pattern: Rectangle, Rectangle, Circle, Rectangle, Rectangle, **Extend it**!

   **Extended Pattern**: Circle, Rectangle, Rectangle. Every two rectangles are followed by a circle.

### Review
Great job learning about shape patterns! Remember:

- Identifying a pattern means figuring out what comes next.
- Extending a pattern means continuing the sequence.
- Creating a pattern means you make up your own repeating sequence of shapes.

Keep practicing, and soon you'll be a shape pattern pro!

### Answers to Practice Problems:

1. Triangle
2. Circle, Rectangle, Rectangle

Now that you've finished the Shape Patterns section, you're ready to move on to the next lesson. Keep up the good work!
