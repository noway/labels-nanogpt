# Telling Time Chapter - Understanding Hours and Minutes

## Section: Understanding Hours and Minutes

Hello Second Graders!

In this section, we're going to learn all about hours and minutes on a clock. We'll explore how we can tell time and how a clock helps us understand the difference between hours and minutes. Telling time is a very important skill that we use every day!

### What is an Hour?

An hour is a unit of time. There are 24 hours in one day. When we look at a clock, the numbers from 1 to 12 represent hours. 

An analog clock has a 'short hand' and a 'long hand'. The short hand is the hour hand because it points to the hour. When the hour hand points to '1', it means it is one o'clock. 

Let’s practice by identifying what hour it is!

**Exercise 1:**

1. The hour hand is on the 3. What time is it in hours? _Answer: Three o'clock (3:00)_
2. The hour hand is halfway between the 7 and the 8. What time is it in hours? _Answer: Seven-thirty (7:30) or Half past seven_
3. The hour hand is just past the 11. What time is it in hours? _Answer: Eleven o'clock (11:00)_

### What is a Minute?

Minutes are another unit of time. There are 60 minutes in one hour. On an analog clock, the long hand shows us the minutes. The clock is divided into 60 'minute' marks. When the minute hand points to the 12, it means it is something o'clock, and we start to count minutes when it moves from the 12.

Each number on the clock also represents 5 minutes. So, if the minute hand points to the 1, it is five minutes past the hour. If it points to the 2, it is ten minutes past the hour, and so on.

**Exercise 2:**

1. The minute hand is on the 6. How many minutes past the hour is this? _Answer: Thirty minutes (30)_
2. The minute hand is on the 9. How many minutes past the hour is this? _Answer: Forty-five minutes (45)_
3. The minute hand is on the 11. How many minutes past the hour is this? _Answer: Fifty-five minutes (55)_

### Putting Hours and Minutes Together

Now that you know about hours and minutes, you can tell the full time that is shown on a clock. Remember, the short hand shows you the hour and the long hand shows you the minute!

**Exercise 3:**

Look at these times and say what time they show:

1. The hour hand is on the 5, and the minute hand is on the 12. _Answer: Five o’clock (5:00)_
2. The hour hand is just before the 9, and the minute hand is on the 3. _Answer: Eight forty-five (8:45) or Quarter to nine_
3. The hour hand is halfway between the 2 and the 3, and the minute hand is on the 6. _Answer: Two-thirty (2:30) or Half past two_

### A.M. and P.M.

One last thing to know is about A.M. and P.M. A.M. stands for the time between midnight and noon (00:00 to 11:59), and P.M. stands for the time between noon and midnight (12:00 to 23:59).

**Exercise 4:**

Indicate A.M. or P.M. for the following activities:

1. Eating lunch at 12:30. _Answer: 12:30 P.M._
2. Going to bed at 9:00. _Answer: 9:00 P.M._
3. Waking up at 7:00. _Answer: 7:00 A.M._

Great job learning about hours and minutes! Now you can practice telling time on your own. Remember to look at which number the hour hand is near and use the minute marks to count the minutes past the hour. And don't forget to use A.M. and P.M. to know if it's morning or night! Keep practicing, and you'll become a time-telling expert in no time!
