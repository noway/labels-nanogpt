**Introduction to Multiplication**

**Multiplying Numbers up to 5**

Welcome to the exciting world of multiplication! Multiplication is a quick way to add the same number many times. It's like a shortcut for addition. 

When we multiply, we use two numbers: one is the number of groups (we call this the "multiplicand") and the other is how many are in each group (we call this the "multiplier"). The result of multiplying two numbers is called the "product".

Let's explore multiplying numbers up to 5 together!

**Exercise 1: Understanding Multiplication**

1. Picture 3 groups of 2 apples. Now, let's write this as a multiplication sentence.
   
   3 groups of 2 apples = 3 x 2
   Answer: 6 apples

2. Think of having 4 baskets, and each basket has 5 oranges.
   
   4 baskets of 5 oranges = 4 x 5
   Answer: 20 oranges

3. Imagine you have 5 packs of stickers, and in each pack, there are 4 stickers.
   
   5 packs of 4 stickers = 5 x 4
   Answer: 20 stickers

**Exercise 2: Multiplication Facts**

Below are some multiplication facts with numbers up to 5. Write down the product for each multiplication fact.

1. 2 x 3 = 6
2. 5 x 1 = 5
3. 1 x 4 = 4
4. 0 x 5 = 0 (Remember, anything times zero is always zero!)
5. 4 x 4 = 16
6. 3 x 5 = 15
7. 5 x 5 = 25
8. 2 x 2 = 4
9. 1 x 3 = 3
10. 4 x 1 = 4

**Exercise 3: Write the Multiplication Sentence**

Look at the objects in each question and write the multiplication sentence. Then, write the answer (product).

1. ***⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️**
   
   4 stars. So the multiplication sentence is:
   
   4 x 1 = 4

2. ***🍎 🍎 🍎**,
   ***🍎 🍎 🍎**
   
   2 groups of 3 apples. So the multiplication sentence is:
   
   2 x 3 = 6

3. **🚗🚗🚗**,
   **🚗🚗🚗**,
   **🚗🚗🚗**
   
   3 groups of 3 cars. So the multiplication sentence is:
   
   3 x 3 = 9

**Exercise 4: Solving Word Problems**

Solve these multiplication word problems by finding the total number of items.

1. Jane has 3 bags. Each bag has 4 marbles. How many marbles does Jane have in total?
   
   3 bags x 4 marbles per bag = 3 x 4 = 12 marbles.

2. There are 5 trees. Each tree has 2 birds sitting in it. How many birds are there in total?
   
   5 trees x 2 birds per tree = 5 x 2 = 10 birds.

3. Tim has 2 boxes. Each box contains 5 toy cars. How many toy cars does Tim have altogether?
   
   2 boxes x 5 toy cars per box = 2 x 5 = 10 toy cars.
