# Basic Addition and Subtraction

## Simple Addition (1-20)

Welcome to the Simple Addition section of our Math Practice book for 2nd grade! Addition is a fundamental mathematical operation that represents the total amount of objects when they are combined into a single group. The ability to quickly and accurately add numbers is an essential skill for young learners.

Below are various addition problems that involve adding numbers between 1 and 20. These exercises will help build your understanding and speed in solving basic addition problems.

### Exercise 1: Single-Digit Addition

Add the following single-digit numbers. Write your answer in the space provided.

1.  3 + 4 = 7
2.  5 + 2 = 7
3.  6 + 1 = 7
4.  8 + 2 = 10
5.  4 + 5 = 9
6.  7 + 3 = 10
7.  2 + 6 = 8
8.  9 + 1 = 10
9.  1 + 8 = 9
10. 4 + 4 = 8

### Exercise 2: Double-Digit and Single-Digit Addition

Now let's try adding a single-digit number to a double-digit number. Remember to start adding from the rightmost digit, which is the ones place.

1.  11 + 4 = 15
2.  14 + 5 = 19
3.  17 + 3 = 20
4.  12 + 6 = 18
5.  18 + 1 = 19
6.  16 + 2 = 18
7.  13 + 7 = 20
8.  15 + 4 = 19
9.  19 + 1 = 20
10. 14 + 4 = 18

### Exercise 3: Double-Digit Addition without Carrying

It's time to add two double-digit numbers! When the sum of the digits in the ones place is less than 10, you do not need to carry over to the tens place.

1.  11 + 7 = 18
2.  13 + 6 = 19
3.  12 + 5 = 17
4.  15 + 4 = 19
5.  10 + 9 = 19
6.  11 + 8 = 19
7.  14 + 2 = 16
8.  12 + 7 = 19
9.  13 + 5 = 18
10. 10 + 8 = 18

### Exercise 4: Double-Digit Addition with Carrying

Sometimes when adding two double-digit numbers, the sum of the digits in the ones place will be 10 or more. In this case, you need to carry over to the tens place.

1.  15 + 6 = 21
2.  17 + 5 = 22
3.  14 + 8 = 22
4.  18 + 3 = 21
5.  16 + 9 = 25
6.  17 + 4 = 21
7.  19 + 2 = 21
8.  15 + 7 = 22
9.  18 + 5 = 23
10. 16 + 7 = 23

### Exercise 5: Review and Practice

Let's review what youâ€™ve learned with some mixed problems. Use the skills you've practiced so far to solve these addition problems. 

1.  5 + 15 = 20
2.  7 + 13 = 20
3.  9 + 8 = 17
4.  6 + 11 = 17
5.  10 + 10 = 20
6.  19 + 1 = 20
7.  17 + 2 = 19
8.  14 + 6 = 20
9.  12 + 5 = 17
10. 8 + 7 = 15
