# Numbers in Our World: Numbers in Stories

## Introduction

Welcome, young mathematicians! In this section, we are going to learn about how numbers can be part of exciting stories and fun activities. Numbers tell us how many, how much, and help us describe the world around us in a way we can understand and share with others. As you read each story, pay attention to the numbers and see if you can find them all!

## Story 1: The Picnic

Once upon a time, there were 3 friends named Annie, Ben, and Charlie. They decided to go on a picnic. Annie brought 2 apples, Ben brought 5 sandwiches, and Charlie brought 4 cookies. How many items of food did they bring in total?

### Exercise:

- Count the apples: **2 apples**
- Count the sandwiches: **5 sandwiches**
- Count the cookies: **4 cookies**
- Now, let's add them all up: **2** apples + **5** sandwiches + **4** cookies = **11** food items in total.

**Answer:** They brought 11 items of food to the picnic.

## Story 2: The Caterpillar's Snack

In the garden crawled a small, hungry caterpillar. On Monday, he ate 1 leaf. On Tuesday, he was still hungry and ate 2 more leaves. Letâ€™s see how many leaves he had eaten by Tuesday.

### Exercise:

- Leaves eaten on Monday: **1 leaf**
- Leaves eaten on Tuesday: **2 leaves**
- Add the leaves from Monday and Tuesday together: **1** leaf + **2** leaves = **3** leaves.

**Answer:** The caterpillar had eaten 3 leaves by Tuesday.

## Story 3: My Colorful Balloons

Emily had a bunch of colorful balloons for her birthday party. She had 1 red balloon, 2 blue balloons, and 4 yellow balloons. How many balloons did Emily have in total?

### Exercise:

- Count the red balloons: **1 red balloon**
- Count the blue balloons: **2 blue balloons**
- Count the yellow balloons: **4 yellow balloons**
- Let's add up all the balloons: **1** red balloon + **2** blue balloons + **4** yellow balloons = **7** balloons.

**Answer:** Emily had 7 balloons for her party.

## Story 4: The Train Cars

There was a toy train with 1 engine and several cars. The train had 4 passenger cars, 2 freight cars, and 1 caboose. How many train cars were there in total?

### Exercise:

- Count the engine: **1 engine**
- Count the passenger cars: **4 passenger cars**
- Count the freight cars: **2 freight cars**
- Count the caboose: **1 caboose**
- Add all the parts of the train: **1** engine + **4** passenger cars + **2** freight cars + **1** caboose = **8** train parts in total.

**Answer:** There were 8 train parts in total.

## Story 5: The Little Ants

Five little ants were marching in a line. They found a pile of 10 sugar cubes. Each ant took 1 sugar cube. How many sugar cubes were left?

### Exercise:

- Start with the total number of sugar cubes: **10 sugar cubes**
- Subtract the number of sugar cubes each ant took: **5 sugar cubes** (because there are 5 ants)
- Calculate the remaining sugar cubes: **10** sugar cubes - **5** sugar cubes = **5** sugar cubes left.

**Answer:** There were 5 sugar cubes left.
